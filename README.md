## Project Overview
**Monetary Economics and Baseball EDA**

In this milestone project, my teammate and I investigated the impact of various economic factors on the financial decisions of baseball teams and how these decisions affect their performance. Specifically, our objective is to perform an EDA on the relationships between federal interest rates, major stock market indices, baseball teams' payroll spending and their hitting, pitching, and overall performance metrics

**Basic Visualizations**

In these assignments, I utilized Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, and Plotly to generate a variety of visualizations that explored U.S. tourism trends, analyzed student grades, mapped air quality with dynamic heatmaps and examined personal fitness data from wearable devices. 

**Advanced Data Visualization**

A collection of my advanced visulization notebooks, demostrating visualization technqiues applied to create cutom plots for more complex datasets. The collection includes notebooks on creating visualizations to explore Star Wars characters and movies, and on creating statistical charts and interactive graphs to analyze Bob Ross' paintings. Techniques employed range from comparative bar graphs and small multiples to interactive visualizations and 2D MDS plots for dimension reduction.
