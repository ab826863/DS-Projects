## Project Description
Our project team have a two stage exploratory analysis. It aims to investigate the impact of various economic factors on the financial decisions of baseball teams and how financial decision affect their performance. Specifically, our objective is to explore how federal interest rates and major stock market indices affect baseball teams' payroll spending, subsequently impacting their hitting, pitching, and overall performance metrics. We will also assess the economic resilience of large market teams compared to the smaller ones. For reference, 8 of the last 10 teams to win the world series have had their payroll rank in the top 10 of the leagueâ€™s highest payrolls.
