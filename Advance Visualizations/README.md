# Advanced Data Visualization Notebooks
This repository showcases my advanced data visualization projects, demonstrating my skills in creating insightful and interactive visualizations for complex datasets. These notebooks reflect my proficiency in using various visualization libraries and techniques to convey meaningful insights.

# Overview
The notebooks in this collection cover:

**1. Re-Create Article Visualization (Altair Practice)**

Focused on re-creating visualizations from an article, this notebook explores the effectiveness of different graph types in conveying information about characters and familiarity across various Star Wars movies and characters.

**2. Statistical Charts and Interactive Graph**

This notebook delves into visualizing conditional probabilities of Bob Ross' drawing habits and assessing color proportions in artworks. Ut provides an interactive exploration of statistical data and patterns.

Technologies: Python, Altair, Pandas, Sciki-Learn

# Summary Insights and Techniques Used

**1. Re-Create Article Visualization (Altair Practice)**

**Bar Graphs for Comparative Analysis:** Utilized bar graphs to compare two nominal variables (location & gender), one ordinal variable (age), and one quantitative variable (familiarity), The goal is to handle multiple data types with custom design to highlight insightful information.

**2.  Statistical Charts and Interactive Graph**

**Small Multiples and Interactive Visualization:** Employed small multiples to visualize conditional probabilities over time and interactive bar plots to assess color proportions in artworks. These visualizations help unraveling the patterns and the dominant use of certain colors in Bob Ross' paintings during different time period.

**2D MDS Plot** Used 2D MDS plot to perform a dimension reduction and visually highlight paintings with similar features. It helps visually highlighting paintings containing specific features of interest. (e.g. barn, bridge, and etc.)
