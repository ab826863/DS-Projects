# NLP Amazon Review Classifier

## Project Description
This project utilized three NLP techniques, bag of words, word vectors, and DistilBERT language model to build a Support Vector Machine classifier to categorize Amazon reviews to their corresponding merchant type (e.g. toys and beauty product). This classifier is a personal project to learn and practice using NLP techniques, machine learning, and large language model.

This classifier has several potential use cases, for example it can be integrated with a program to automatically categorize customer response to products on social media platform like twitter and send those response to appropriate product specialists who are in charge of that specific type of product. It can also be used to classify social media posts to personalize marketing strategies based on the interest of specific categories of products.

## Data
Amazon review data retrieved from Stanford Network Analysis Project

## Features
**Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The project preprocessed Amazon review data by randomly selecting 5000 Amazon Reviews for 8 different categories. Then, they are splitted into 2500 training data and 2500 testing data for each category.

**Model Training**: Implements support vector machine and DistilBERT sequence classifier to classify review data.

**Evaluation Metrics**: Incorporates evaluation metrics, accuracy and F1 score to assess the performance of the classifiers.

## Installation
To install this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone [repository link]
cd NLP_Amazon_Review_Classifier

```

## Project Background

This project is part of my personal journey to explore and learn about Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and techniques. Currently, I am engaged in NLP coursework and actively expanding my knowledge in the field of NLP and Large Language Model (LLM). 

The NLP Amazon Review Classifier is a practical application of the concepts and skills I'm acquiring. I am excited to further explore the capabilities of LLMs through this project and future projects. I am planning to revisit this project as I garner more in-depth knowledge of NLP and LLM.
