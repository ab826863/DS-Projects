I learned more about this computer from the reviews already written than I did from reading over the manuals.  I learned about features that I would have never thought about.  Amazon is awesome and reviewers like the ones here are part of what makes it so awesome.\n\nMy review is going to come from a different place. I am a casual user who wanted a printer that is FAST, and had office multi-function capabilities.\n\nFor me, with a Windows 7 computer and typical wi-fi the setup was uneventful and the printer works fine from any computer in the house.  I am even able to access it from my iPhone/Apple devices and my Android phones and devices.\n\nThe speed was one of the main draws for me with this printer.  As usual, I feel like they must print sheets of paper with the letter \"a\" to get their advertised speeds.  I don't get the same speeds as advertised, but this printer is FAST.  First page out seems to be the more disappointing speed, but it is not terribly slow.  Don't get me wrong - it is fast.  I just think they print some best-case scenario that isn't likely in the real world.\n\nOverall, I don't use every feature this printer offers.  I wanted speed and this printer mostly offers that - once it get going it spits out paper fast. It is up to date and has all the modern tech, apps, wi-fi, bluetooth, etc...\n\nIt is a great printer... but there is one thing that I feel brings it down a notch.  I'm knocking a star off for the price.  This is an EXPENSIVE printer and although it is very good, we are still talking about a black and white laser printer with a lot of goodies in an era where printers have become commodities that cost virtually nothing unless they are art quality color printers.  You can fax via phone, and scan from most $99 printers.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm recommending this printer all the way.  It is outstanding at everything I have thrown at it.  If you need the features of this printer, then it is a solid choice.  But if you only need a subset of these features, then you might want to find a much cheaper printer that does only the features you need at a better price.\n\n4 stars for features and quality.\n-1 star for price and as another reviewer mentioned, expensive consumables (drum)", "summary": "A different perspective", "unixReviewTime": 1403136000}

There are options to adjust the color and to brighten or darken. Then you convert. There is a playback button so you can review and edit the converted images. The converted product can easily be uploaded to a computer. You can also view the images on a tv if it is \"equipped with RCA composite ports that accept video-in signal\". I have not tried that as the contained screen on the device works well.

But after using it for a while, I must say that it has plenty of room in which to maneuver my mouse.  The gel pad is comfortable although I prefer a little softer wrist pad. But it is soft enough.  It is certainly softer than some gel pads I've examined.  The backside of the mouse pad has a sticky surface to prevent the pad from scooting around on your desk. The actual mouse pad surface seems to have a very fine texture which should benefit the mouse's resolution. I am using a Microsoft mouse and it works very well on this surface.  The Belkin mouse pad wears out after a year or so because the cloth like surface becomes too smooth and slick.  Some mice such as Logitech's mice stop working at that point. That is why I switched back to a Microsoft mouse. My Microsoft mouse really glides surprisingly well on the surface of this 3M mouse pad. It feels almost like an air puck. The overall construction of this mouse pad is robust. The mouse pad is thick, about three sixteenths of an inch thick. That is considerably thicker than most mouse pads. I think I will take this mouse pad with me when I travel.  Sometimes on an airplane or other places, you can benefit from a thicker mouse pad.  Sometimes I use some pretty weird surfaces when I am at an airport.  I just hate the touch pads on laptops.

Along with the known issue of vertical scan lines, my prints would be ruined with criss-cross lines if scan to computer for copy or fax, etc..\n\n******\nOriginal Review:\nGood all-in-one printer with some MAJOR drawbacks. This is my fourth HP printer and will probably be my last. I will continue to use my older 990cse Deskjet for document tasks as it outputs superior print quality - rich laser-sharp texts and vibrant colors due to its PhotoREt and Layered Technology which I think HP no longer uses. I will compare this to an Epson Artisan 810 a.i.o. purchased mainly for Photo and CD/DVD media printing as it does the job very well, but the Epson lacked in the area of text quality and/or document tasks.\n\nFirst of all, print quality matters, and I'm not talking about photo. The whole idea of a great all-in-one is how well it performs its duty tasks such as scan, copy, the occasional fax, and most importantly - print quality on documents using regular inkjet paper. For this the 8620 seemed to handle well, at least on the printing part.\n\nPROS: What I like.....\nPrinting: It is fast and the printed texts are reasonably good compared to my Epson. Colors are also more vibrant. Though overall good and presentable but I find that the texts are not as sharp compared to two of my older Deskjets.\n\nAuto 2-sided scanning: Very convenient and works very well. I haven't encounter any paper jamming during the trial, but this feature comes with one major flaw (read cons below)\n\nCopying: Good, but final results differs between if using adf or flatbed. Aside from the smeared vertical scan lines when using adf (a known issue) the overall results are more 'noise' compared to scans utilizing the flatbed. There are no settings for this other than resolution and it seems to be universal.\n\nFaxing: Works well just like any other fax machine, but this simple feature would be the least use for most people so I will not get into it much. The only issue: there isn't an option for me to 'silence' the ring whenever someone calls me at home.\n\nCONS: What I dislike....\nScanning:  Okay, the worst of all. Read along....\nAs mentioned before regarding using the adf, you will have two problems, vertical scan lines and output results are different when using the flatbed. Also, scanned materials are much more noisier than my Epson.\nWhile using the adf for scanning or copying there is a major flaw across the current 8600 series where fine thin vertical lines would occur on the finished product. This is caused by dusts and debris lodged inside the adf roller and along the scanning bed area. HP advises to clean but this seemed to be an ongoing maintenance and/or problem with no real solution or fix.\n\nMy BIGGEST problem and inconvenience is when using the 'Scan to Computer' feature. Whether you save it to pdf or jpeg it will be a long process...\nIt requires 6 steps to scan a document to your computer, yes SIX! To begin, you choose and press these on the screen:\n1. Press Scan\n2. Press Computer\n3. Press Select Computer\n4. Press Scan as (pdf, jpeg, etc)\n5. Press Start Scan\nwhen finished\n6. Do you need to scan another: Press Yes, No.\nThen you get the finished product. This is a very stupid feature which you must choose or wait at least 5 minutes for the scanned item to appear if you don't respond.\n\nOn my Epson, you choose either 'Scan to PC' or 'Scan to PDF', then choose the computer and the task starts immediately w/o having you go through all the merry-go-round or if you want to scan another item and delaying the process. Obviously if I want to, I will scan again myself.\nThis is a definite no no for me as I do a lot of scanning, but anyone who decides to scan a few pages would very easily get annoyed.\n\nScan quality:\nToo much noise/artifacts. Adjusting resolution and selecting 'photo' or 'document' option did not help. This applies to both jpeg and pdf files. The scanned results from my Epson yields super smooth picture and retained its original depths and colors, also output file size are smaller compared to the HP 8620. This means better quality without taking up a lot of space.\n\nTouchscreen:\nWay too sensitive. Also being a dust-magnet, I couldn't even put a towel on top to cover the machine without having the edges swiping and initializing it from sleep. The screen is not designed for moisture-sensitive touch but rather to everything, meaning you can swipe the corners of a piece of paper and it will initialize. My towel tends to open up the 'date setting' and swapped a few years back.\n\nFlatbed cover:\nThe hinges will not expand upwards for book copying. You'd have to hold the book down and cover as much as you can with the cover to reduce light.\n\nHP Printer Assistant Software:\nIf you are using Windows with more than one user, you MUST install the driver software for ALL users otherwise they will get the 'Scan to PC' not enabled pop-up box every time they log in. This seemed to be a delay and will eventually 'enable' itself after a while but the box hangs indefinitely until one closes. It is a nuisance with the reminder, and the fact that the driver software needs to be installed for every user.\nThis doesn't seem to affect Mac users as I've only installed once and for all (three users).\n\nI'm not even going to get into photo-printing as I know this will not compare to my Artisan 810 (which uses a 6-ink cartridge system for maximum photo quality). HP is good for office tasks, at least with my older units and it is a shame that they are only stand-alone printers. My Epson Artisan would be newest for being 5 years old, but it lacks mobile printing. The HP8620 comes loaded with features but lacking major in other aspects that I needed most. Will decide if this will be a keeper and reserve each task for each unit. But then 'clutterness' will be another issue.", "summary": "Great all-in-one with MAJOR drawbacks!", "unixReviewTime": 1429574400}

If you want just the highlights as to why, see my Short Notes below. If you want the full review, go to Detailed Notes further down.\nShort Notes:\n- Excellent quality overall, good ergonomics.\n- 8 MB RAM, easily sufficient to store a wide variety of applications plus data.\n- Has 2 MB flash memory, enough to handle upgraded (v3.5) OS.\n- Sharp, clear screen. Easy to read.\n- Graffiti handwriting recognition is forgiving and easy to master quickly.\n- Great battery life - should last over 30 days.\n- Built-in infrared port - easy data exchange between Palm devices.\n- Many available software applications, often freeware.\n- Excellent and thorough documentation.\n- Easy to learn how to use it - very intuitive if you hate manuals.\n- Syncs well with Microsoft Outlook, if you're so inclined.\n- Great price - a good investment.\n\nDetailed Notes:\nSpent a lot of time deciding which Palm OS model to go with, and finally picked the Palm IIIxe, primarily for the newer OS (v3.5), the 8 MB memory and the new lower price. Looked closely at the Palm m110 and Handspring Visor, units which offered attractive prices, but with 2 MB RAM, felt they didn't have enough memory. Also considered the Handspring Visor Deluxe, but on the two models that I had a chance to try out, the screens weren't the same quality as those of the Palm IIIxe, and nobody could explain it.\nYou may also wish to consider the new Palm m105. See the notes at the bottom of this review for more details.\nTo be fair, I also considered some of the newer Windows CE devices, but was put off completely by the hand recognition software. It was too slow and hard to use, so that idea was dropped quickly. Used to use a Windows CE device made by Casio, which I put aside awhile ago. Had initially been encouraged to purchase a Palm device by one of my co-workers, but I felt that the Windows CE 1.0 device with its tiny keyboard was the way to go. Then I found out that it ate batteries at a very high rate. Lived with this for awhile, but the business of hardware ROM replacement to upgrade the unit was disturbing.\nThe Palm does everything I need it to, and in the month that I've had it, I've been pleasantly surprised by its versatility. The quality has proven to be excellent. The case of the IIIxe, though an older Palm design, fits the hand quite comfortably.\nThe Palm IIIxe comes with 8MB of memory. In useful terms, this means that you can store approximately 12,000 addresses, 5-10 years of appointments (that's about 3000 appointments), 6000 to do items, 3000 memos, 800 e-mails and many applications. The available memory has been ample to download and store a wide range of applications along with the room to store related data. The IIIxe (along with some other models) has 2 MB flash memory, enough to handle the upgraded (v3.5) OS and the built-in applications. I also went to the Palm Web site and downloaded the latest (v. 3.5.2) OS and installed it. There were absolutely no problems like I had heard about with other \"Palm-compatible\" devices.\nThe screen is sharp, clear and easy to read, indoors or outside. Though I might have preferred a bit stronger backlight for those times where there isn't much light, have learned to adapt to it quickly.\nThe Graffiti handwriting recognition is forgiving and easy to master quickly. One of the reasons I went to a Windows CE keyboard unit a few years ago was fear of having to learn yet another way of inputting data. I couldn't have been more wrong - it's easy and quite intuitive. What's even more important is that I'm now taking notes in meeting with the device that used to be done on paper.\nThe battery life is outstanding. It should last thirty days or more under regular use. Since one of my complaints with the Windows CE units was short battery life, I'm impressed.\nThe built-in infrared port allows you to transfer documentation directly from any other infrared enabled Palm device. This function works quite well. I've transferred memos to and from a Handspring Visor Deluxe and other Palm devices.\nThere are many software applications available for the Palm PDAs, including a lot of shareware and freeware. The commercial programs that are available are top rate, and you can even find applications that will let you edit Word and Excel files. You can even connect to Oracle 8I databases with currently available software.\nThe Palm IIIxe manuals are excellent, and do a thorough job of documentation. You may find, though, that this device is easy to learn with little reading. Its interface is very intuitive, and that's helpful if you dislike going through manuals.\nThis PDA syncs well with Microsoft Outlook, which is extremely useful for corporate users. This is a straightforward operation in which you place the Palm IIIxe into the supplied HotSynch cradle and push the button on the base. The HotSynch operation creates a log of what was done, so you can confirm that everything was updated correctly.\nPicky point - comes with a mediocre lightweight plastic stylus. Order an upgrade (or the Palm 3-pack) immediately. You won't regret it.\nYou might also want to consider the new Palm m105. Though it has a smaller screen than the Palm IIIxe, it has many of the same features but is packed in the same case as the popular m100.\nIf you are looking for a reasonably priced PDA that can live up to its reputation, then this is a first-rate choice. The Palm IIIxe is a solid unit at a great price - an excellent investment.\n(Please note that this is a re-posted review.)", "summary": "Palm IIIxe - excellent product and an exceptional value.", "unixReviewTime": 990576000}

The photos were stunning and attracted a lot of attention. I had no problem with color shifts, having calibrated my monitor and used the Canon print drivers. I used a Mac G5 and Photoshop Elements. I printed approximately 55 - 8.5 x 11 (cropped to 7 x 10.5) and 32 - 13 x 19 photos. This calculates to approx 83 sq feet of photos. I used Canon inks and Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy. Here are the stats for the ink usage for this project:\n\nPhoto Magenta 4 cartridges\n\nPhoto Cyan  3\n\nYellow  2\n\nCyan  1\n\nMagenta  1\n\nBlack  1\n\nRed  2/3\n\nGreen  1/4\n\nSo ~ 13 cartridges of ink were needed to print 83 sq ft of photos. Assuming a cost of $12/cartridge, this means $156 to print 83 sq ft, or 12000 sq in. This is about 1.3 cents (.013) per square inch. So ink costs for an 8 X 10 would be $1.04, for a 13 x 19, $3.21.\n\nNow, the part that intrigued me, how would this printer perform printing black and white? For my source I used a 2 1/4 monochrome negative that I scanned. I imported the scan into Photoshop in grayscale mode. A direct print to 8.5 x 11 Kodak Ultima High Gloss looked quite good as far as color (compared to my darkroom print). However, I don't recommend this paper with this printer since the ink will smear if water contacts it. I tried printing the same negative on Canon Photo Paper Plus and was disappointed to find that the print was tinged with green. So I began checking the print settings and here is how to correct it so the green tinge disappears. Under Color Options, make sure Color Corrections is set to ColorSync (for Macs), or None. Under Quality and Media, make sure the Grayscale box is off (unchecked). Of course make sure the media type matches the paper you're printing on. This seems to make all the difference.\n\nNow the amazing discovery....I was checking to see how water-impermeable the Canon paper/ink combination was, so I used one of the green-tinged prints for my test. I found that by wiping the print with a damp soft cloth, the green tinge disappeared and a beautiful, neutral black and white print appeared!!!\n\nI'm not sure what is happening here, since if I wipe a color print on Canon paper, no smearing or color change is observed. I would be interested to know if those who have found magenta tints on their prints can wipe them and observe this.\n\nI have had excellent results using Konica Premium Silky paper with this printer (no smearing).\n\nThe only problem I observed, was that when printing multiple 13 x 19 photos, I saw a small smudge of black ink in the upper left hand corner on some prints. This disappeared when I took a break and resumed printing.\n\nThis is a class-act printer. Very quiet, and fast (compared to Epson). I will be buying one shortly, although I see that Canon may introduce some new printers this Fall with large format capabilities and new ink systems.

Oh, it printed OK. Photo's look nice, fairly fast & easy to setup the wifi wireless connection. It's the ink consumption that ticks me off! I bought it because it has separate cartridges for each color thinking I could just replace what ever color ran out first. Wrong. First set of ink cartridges was gone in no time even though I hardly printed anything. Figured it was because they were the ones that came with it and HP was just being cheap by sending ink cartridges with it that were only half, or less, full. It wouldn't let me just replace the black and keep printing text pages either. No, it had to have all of them replaced. I bet I didn't get a dozen pages printed with it over a 3 to 4 month period and it was out of ink. ALL of the cartridges were empty! And I didn't even print a single photo, only text pages. I got one more set and put in it. This time I shut it down when I wasn't printing something. Didn't matter. Every time it was turned on it ran a full head cleaning cycle before it would print. I even put the extra large black cartridge in it but that didn't matter. It used the Photo Black for text printing. And guess what? In less than 4 months every cartridge was empty even though I only used it a few time to print something. Except for the extra large black, it was still over half full but the thing wouldn't print anything with the other ones empty. This is the first printer that I retired before it was actually broken. I wonder if it was intentional by HP to make money selling ink cartridges? After this one, I'm never buying another HP printer again.", "summary": "Worst printer ink addict ever, DO NOT BUY!", "unixReviewTime": 1363824000}

I was using a basic laser printer, very cheap toner and so very user friendly to me. But it didn't have a lot of flexibility. I had to use another printer for scanning and copying, and have been looking for something to do double sided printing, so as to save paper.\n\nThis printer fit the bill perfectly. It was easy to set up and easy to use. This model doesn't have the wireless access of other models, but I didn't need that.  It can be networked, however, so that is enough for me.\n\nIt has a pretty small footprint for its capabilities.  Everything is tightly packaged and engineered so that there's no wasted space. It is very functional and works great in all of its capacities that I used it for.  It was my go to printer, the one that I used the most (I have about 4 other printers each with their own speciality).  This is an all around workhorse--not the best at any particular job, but competent at a lot. I even was able--in this day and age--to use the fax feature.  Had to fax a form to our insurance company.  Plugged it into the phone line, dialed the number, everything worked quickly, smoothly with absolutely no bumps.  This printer really is just plain easy to use.\n\nMy one complaint about the printer itself is that it's really surgey.  Meaning that when it turns on, it really draws in a lot of power. I couldn't plug it into my UPS because of that. It kept tripping the power circuit.  We have an old house and my office is an old add-on room off the side.  So the wiring isn't the best. When I turn this printer on, it has a tendency to trip the circuit breaker at times, and otherwise affect other things that are plugged in. I've not had that problem with other printers or devices.\n\nStill, the bother was worth it to me. I liked this printer a lot. Note my use of the past tense.\n\nThe trouble I am now running into is not really one connected to the printer itself. But it radically affects my use of the printer.  I am a PhD student and adjunct professor. My home office budget, thus, is pretty bare bones.  While I need functional equipment, I can't pay the frankly outrageous prices charged for the manufacturer's stock toner.  I've long relied on other manufacturers who make generic brand toners and cartridges for my printeres.  So, when after printing about 1200+ pages the toner that this printer came with needed to be replaced and I looked on Amazon for generic substitutes. Found one, got it, installed it. The printer didn't recognize it. Called the company (Inkers). They were great, said I had the right model of cartridge, so they sent me another one. That one didn't work either (got refund quick by the company). Tried another brand.  Also didn't work. Cartridge fit, but the chip wasn't right. Tried a refill company. The replacement chip they sent also didn't work.\n\nMeaning I can't find a cheaper generic toner for this printer and I can't quite get to paying the full toner price. So, for now, this printer sits unplugged and unused.\n\nADDED (April, 2013): First an update about the generic toner. They seem to have worked that out, so now I can print using the cheaper toner. However, I've run into another problem. If you're printing large amounts, this printer really starts slowing down. I'm printing out my dissertation, and when it hit 140 pages, it apparently overheats and prints five pages, stops for about 12 seconds, then prints another 5 pages, stops for 12 seconds.  So, this really makes printing out long documents extremely time consuming.  Given that I need to print out 5 copies of my 332 page dissertation, it means I really, really don't like this printer right now.", "summary": "Really like this printer except for one big caveat", "unixReviewTime": 1349827200}

I am not allowed to hang any electronics or shelving on my apartment walls so mounting my TV & saving space would not be happening.\n\nI noticed my friend in the apartment across from me had a stand she mounted her TV on and her living room seemed so much bigger than mine. I asked her for more information and she directed me to Amazon to find the one she bought.\n\nWhile I could not find an exact copy of her stand I found a better one! This stand/cart has TWO shelving options, I knew this would be perfect for my apartment! I have a projector that I mounted to the top shelving unit (above the TV) and I use the bottom one to place my keyboard on when I am not using it. I love that I can lower my TV or raise it higher with the adjustable height system this cart provides.\n\nThe wheels are a nice touch, I can roll the cart anywhere I desire. I have my TV hooked up to my PC so I really never have a need to move it around but when I am cleaning I like that I can roll it out and vacuum underneath.\n\nThe main two bars do have a unnoticeable (if you are not looking for them) opening for cords to run through them instead of being outside and exposed. If all I had was a projector and a TV box (cable box) then those wires would fit perfectly fine in the bars and they would be out of sight. Since I have my TV hooked to my computer I do have multiple cords that would not fit but that is fine with me. The cart saves plenty of space by keeping the devices raised off of the ground and in one area.\n\nThe only small dislike I have is that the caps that cover the legs of the stand do come off often with little kids around playing on the floor. Once they seen that the caps can be removed they take them off any chance they can when I am not looking which exposes a not so kid friendly edge. I have hit my foot on it once and it was not fun. I am thinking about using a hot glue gun to hold them in place.\n\nI love that I can lower my TV enough to see the projector image on the wall. This makes it easy for me to multitask and in my opinion is one of the best features!\n\nAssembly was pretty simple when following the directions, although it did take about 45mins from gathering all the pieces and putting it together. The picture on the outside of the box made it easy to see what it was going to look like and gave me a nice reference to work off of. I am very happy with the quality of the materials, they do not feel cheap and I had everything that I needed to put the cart together in the box. The stand is sturdy and holds up well to all of the weight. 5/5 stars, very satisfied and I highly recommend!

The labels are identical in every way except size, so my review for the 2\"x2\" labels is copied here.]\n\nI own a small specialty foods store, and when we have fresh bread left over at the end of the day, we freeze it and sell it out of the freezer later. For months I've been looking for a way to label the individual bagged breads with the information we normally provide when we're selling it fresh -- bread name, price, ingredients, and baker info. All the labels I was able to find, though, either didn't hold up to being frozen, or couldn't be run through a printer. While these GHS labels are certainly overkill for my needs, since there's no other product on the market that does meet my needs, these are a godsend.\n\nMy questions upon first use were, 1) will they actually stick to the plastic bags?, and 2) do I really have to use a laser printer? The answers are both yes.\n\n1. These labels *don't* stick well to plastic bags if the bags are some combination of cold/wet/not flat when the labels are applied, and for that reason they lose a star. They also take a few minutes to really adhere even in perfect conditions. So in order to get them to stick and stay stuck, I apply them to empty bags, smooth them out, wait a few minutes, and then put a loaf in the bag and put the whole thing in the freezer. I haven't done scientific testing of how long it takes for the stickers to really adhere, but within a few minutes I can still peel them off the bag; by the next day removing them would require ripping the bag.\n\n2. I have a Canon inkjet printer at home, not one of the fancy inkjets they say might work with these. Some other reviewers say you can use an inkjet it just won't be waterproof, and I don't really need waterproof, so I thought I'd try it. I printed a sheet, let it sit in the tray for 20-30 minutes to dry, picked it up, touched the ink, and -- instant smudge. Everywhere. Even after 20-30 minutes to dry, these weren't not waterproof, they were just pools of ink sitting on top of the label. Had I been interested in getting ink all over my hands, I'm sure I could have wiped the labels practically clean. I have not had any issues with laser-printed labels smudging, so the answer is yes, you really really do need a laser printer for them!\n\nGiven that I'm not actually using them for chemicals, I haven't used the special Avery software for that purpose. I was able to find an Avery template for InDesign for 12-up 2\"x2\" stickers which worked great. My only alignment problems turned out to be user error, which disappeared once I realized I'd set my text boxes with asymmetrical margins. Oops.\n\nOverall, I can vouch for the ability of these labels to adhere even at 0 deg F, and to remain smudge-free when used with a laser printer.

Curnutt", "reviewText": "I was approached by Smart Weigh to see if I would be interested in providing a review for their product.  I agreed and they shipped the little scale to me.\n\nThe packaging was good, it was well protected from any shipping damage.  The box contained the following:\n1.  The base scale\n2.  The Display unit\n3.  The power cable\n4.  The connection cable for the display unit to the base scale\n\nNice features:\n1.  The connection cable for the display unit allows you to move the display to different distances from the base scale to accommodate different size objects that you want to weigh.  This is an improvement over other scales that had the display attached to the base unit.\n2.  You can change the display to show the following weights:\n  a.  pounds\n  b.  ounces\n  c.  grams\n3.  There is a \"Tare\" mode, this allows you to weigh the container separately to produce a tare weight.  Then when you place the packaged item on the scale it will adjust the weight to remove the \"Tare\" weight from the end result.\n4.  You can use the scale in a location without electricity by turning on the unit using only the batteries.\n\nI measured a multitude of items on the scale to see it's accuracy and was pleasantly surprised that this small scale weighed everything within very acceptable tolerances.  It was kind of fun to switch between modes to see what the different weights were.\n\nOne thing we found nice as that you could use this while cooking to measure the items that you need to add to a recipe.  So, let's say you need to add 6 ounces of chopped onions.  You can put the cutting board on the scale and take a \"Tare\" weight of the cutting board.  Then you can take it aside, chopped onions on it and place the cutting board back on the scale and weigh it in the ounces mode with it adjusting for the \"Tare\" weight of the cutting board.  So you can see if you have cut enough onion or to much.\n\nThis simple scale can be used in a small business to weigh packages, or it can be used at home for weighing packages or ingredients for a recipe or any other type of measurement you need.\n\nOverall it is a smart design (thus the name Smart Weigh) and compact.  It can easily be stored back in it's box if you don't want it out all the time, and take practically no time to pull it out of the box and set up.\n\nOh, and I forgot to mention that you can calibrate the device so that if you have some tolerance issues because of atmosphere or altitude changes you can be sure the device is giving you accurate measurements no matter what.\n\nGreat little device and the price is wonderful (yes I got mine free, but I wouldn't be opposed to the price if I bought it).\n\nEnjoy!", "summary": "Simple Design, Accurate Weighing", "unixReviewTime": 1396656000}

I am very happy with the result.  I am saving money and getting results much more to my liking than by having my slides and negatives scanned by a service.  I am a power-user who is knowledgeable about photography, so this choice will not suit everyone.\n\nScanning of negatives and slides in high resolution (4800 dpi and higher) is slow, but you can't get faster without spending a lot more money.  The Digital Ice technology is a must for scanning slides and negatives and works VERY well.  I removes the appearance of dust without a negative impact on quality.  Don't scan slide or negatives without it.\n\nI usually scan slides and negatives at 4800 DPI and that gives quite detailed images.  I scan to TIF format and then use a good photo editor to do corrections (exposure, cropping, color balance, resize) and export JPG format final versions in the 3-5 MP size range (but you can resize and compress to get smaller sizes if you want).  Then I delete the TIF files.\n\nI have some 25 ISO Kodachrome slides which have a lot of fine detail, so I scan them at 6400 DPI which gives a very nice result, but it is slow and results in very large file sizes.  I crop or resize the 6400 DPI scans of 25 ISO Kodachrome slides to 30 MP images (6300 x 4725) or smaller.  I have not tried higher than that.  The detail in the scans at this high resolution is higher than I expected.\n\nI would buy this scanner again.  I think that Epson makes the best scanners for my use.  I would not buy a less expensive Epson scanner than the v500 for my use.  If my pockets were deeper I would opt for something a little faster.", "summary": "Great scanner", "unixReviewTime": 1273449600}

Ink is so expensive and she prints so much material for her classroom that the amount we pay is worth every penny.\n\nShe prints on cardstock (pretty thick) and regular paper and the results are very acceptable.\n\nPrinting photos is a different story though.  I thought it would be fun to try to print a few photos on high quality paper, big mistake.  First problem is it took me 4 prints to get the colors right.  I have a color correct monitor for photo editing, and the picture is perfect there.  I had to make it excessively yellow and unsaturated to get an acceptable print.  Also once printed, even after 24 hours, the ink gets all over your fingers.  HP would probably blame the paper, but I have used that exact same paper on my professional photo printer and there is no smudging seconds after the image comes out of the printer.  The problem is the ink, not the paper.\n\nAmazing printer for non-photo work.  Stay away if you're printing photos though.\n\nAnother tip, if you're using a Mac - DO NOT USE ADOBE READER to print PDFs.  Adobe Reader is the worst software ever created.  My wife was having problems where the printer wasn't centering pages, and we even called HP support.  After a lot of research I kept finding clues that the Adobe Reader software was problematic, so we did a test.  I opened the PDF in the built in Mac PDF reader \"Preview\" and in Adobe.

I wanted a scanner that could handle the backlog, but could then be used for maintenance. This Swingline product was an Amazon special the day I went looking so I decided to give it a try. I have been mostly happy with it, with a couple of complaints.\n\nFirst of all, the 25 page feeder works as advertised as long as:\n  -no pages are stapled together\n  -the pages are all more or less the same size\n  -the feeder is not over-filled\n\nIf there are pages stapled together, or if there is a random small piece of paper (such as a receipt) mixed in, then it will probably end up jamming. Clearing jams is not a big deal most of the time, but it does detract a bit from the value of having an auto feeder. these complaints aside, the auto feeder did save me a lot of time. I grabbed stacks of paper, placed them in the tray and walked away. Ten minutes later I came back and put some more in. Every 2-3 rounds I emptied the bin with the shredded paper and kept going. I went through dozens of batches over 4 days and by the time I was done I had filled 8 garbage bags of shredded paper, which I dutifully recycled.\n\nThe top chute allows you to take care of stapled pages, credit cards, non-standard-sized- items, etc. In fact the top chute is what I mostly use nowadays. It's powerful enough to handle a few pages at once.\n\nThe cross-cut functionality is essential in ensuring data security today, and this device makes reasonable small pieces. I feed bills in diagonally so that I can be reasonably sure that no piece ends up with a complete account number.\n\nit's quiet enough while operating - certainly quieter than the older shredder I owned previously.\n\nbottom line - I recommend this for people looking to clear up their backlog of paper documents and don't want to stand around all day feeding documents by hand into a shredder.", "summary": "Very good shredder but the auto feeder does jam when it runs into anything non-standard", "unixReviewTime": 1388361600}

In fact, most glues are best suited for specific purposes; that is why there are so many different kinds.\n\nRubber cement is unique in a few ways.  It is not water based; that is evident as soon as you open the jar.  It smells of an organic solvent.  You don't want to breathe in a lot of that.  Best to use it in a ventilated area.\n\nIn the name of the product is what it excels at: \"no wrinkle\".  The solvent in it causes the cement to reduce in volume as it dries, that is, it shrinks, so it makes a snug fit.\n\nIt is especially well suited to gluing fairly flexible things - like paper or foil - to many other things, like paper, foil, plastic, wood, metal, etc.  The solvent could be reactive to some things, making it unsuitable for some materials.  Items glued down with rubber cement can often be peeled away even after the glue has dried; the glue can usually be rubbed off.  On some porous substances (some kinds of paper) the glue could soak in and change the color.\n\nIt may also be suited for fixing items together in a temporary fashion, in which case the glue can often be rubbed off.  But when attached to rigid materials and especially when protected (e.g. covered with a laminate) it is reasonably permanent.\n\nBecause it is not water soluble, it might be handy for joining things that need to stay stuck while immersed in water.\n\nIt is used a lot by all kinds of crafts.  I like to print templates or labels designed on the computer, then trim them with scissors or a paper cutter, then use rubber cement to attach it to metal, plastic, or wood.  Then I take it down to the shop and use the printed guides to cut or drill.  I can also overlay the result with clear laminate to have a permanent, protected and professional-looking panel, for example in electronics projects.\n\nRubber cement is not especially well suited to joining hard things to other hard things - materials like plastic, wood, metal, and so on - except for temporary purposes, in which case it can be very handy if you need to separate them later and remove the glue.  For example, to cut sheet aluminum, I may glue plywood to both sides with rubber cement for more rigidity, cut it, then remove the plywood.\n\nLast, chemical interactions with old-style (pre-digital) photographs could potentially fade the photographic image with time; this may apply to other kinds of printed material with time as well.", "summary": "Special-purpose cement excels for some purposes, unsuitable for others", "unixReviewTime": 1341100800}

Case", "reviewText": "Do you know someone whos obsessed with the song, I Like to Move It; you know, the song that hit the top 100 charts in 1994? Its a song by Reel 2 Real (Erick Morillo) featuring ragga vocals by rapper The Mad Stuntman (Mark Quashie). Well, if you do know someone like that, and that special someone also has a birthday coming up, then this will be absolutely perfect! That person will laugh themselves silly over the crazy chicken moving it to the beat.\n\nHowever, if you plan to send this to anyone who may not know that song, then forget it! For them, this card will neither be funny nor intelligible. It will fall flatter than a pancake.\n\nI was born a couple of generations too early for this song to be part of my music culture. I didn't know it. When I opened the card and heard it for the first time, it sounded like unintelligible racket. I listened to it at least a dozen times. It never got clearer. Each time I heard not one word that was understandableand with the poor quality of the card music systemhonestlyit sounded like noise. Even the beat was unpleasant.\n\nBut then I investigated the songand everything changed!\n\nThe back of the card told me what song it was supposed to be. I listened to parts of it on the Internet. I watched a few music videos featuring the song. It didn't take long before I got hookedand Im saying this as a classical-music-loving 69-year-old woman. Yes, I started to love that song. It stuck in my ear like an earworm and I kept wanting to move it (i.e., the lower parts of my body) to the beat.\n\nI could definitely understand why some folks would get this song planted in their heads obsessively. What a crazy fun song with a contagious dance beat!\n\nWell, after all that, I listened to the card again, and finally got it! I understood every word, appreciated the beat, and laughed at the chicken. My brain knew the song and filled in for what the card lacked in music quality.\n\nSo the lesson is: this card is perfect for someone who you already know loves this song (probably someone born in the 1970s). But if you're not sure, buy another card.\n\nOne final piece of advice: if you're willing to spend the extra bucks to buy a music card, its a good idea to buy it on Amazon. They don't cost any less in the store; I checked it out. Why? If you buy it from Amazon, youll be sure that the cards battery is 100% fresh, not worn down my countless people trying it out in the store before deciding not to buy it.\n\nMy card arrived in perfect condition in a big padded envelope.\n\n[I received a complimentary version of this card in exchange for an honest review. ]", "summary": "Gotta know and love the song then the card will be perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1456272000}

They told me they couldn't instantly send me another part unless I would give them my credit card number so they could old back $50 till such a time as I return the defective product.  They wouldn't accept a debit card with mastercard logo only a true credit card.  Lexmark never required this when I had one of there printers though their was other issues going on there.\n\nI was glad that I didn't go this route because brother would only give me the body of the printer not a brand new one even though it was basically a D.O.A. right from the start. I returned it to amazon for a brand new one with no hassle free so Kudso to amazon for that.\n\nI did an exchange of the printer and the new one was not defective so that was a good thing below is a list of pros and cons.\n\nPRO:\n\n1. It is one of the fastest printers for the price range\n2. The ink is one of the cheapest out there.\n3. It can duplex and scan duplex.\n\nCONS:\n\n1. When printing a large quantity of duplexing sheets it skips either one side or spits out blank pieces of paper.  I had this happen to 15 of my sheets of paper.\n2. When the fax decides to take control or there is a jam it won't let you simply turn off the printer until the problem is resolved instead it just says busy and you have to to physically unplug the printer and plug it back in to have it usable again.\n3.  When using non standard paper there is no option to use a custom setting.  While you can use custom paper it is very limited and not intuitive.  For example for me to successfully print onto a 9X12 piece of paper I was told it would only accept it from the back feeder and even then it seemed to only work when you went into settings and said fit to page.  Even with this option selected it would not work if you were putting it in the front trays.\n4. The trays seemed a bit flimsy and letter paper would only work if they were put in the tray the long way (landscape) instead of the short way.  Other printers capable of handling two trays that are wide format can accept both letter and tabloid paper going the same direction (i.e. Epson workforce 7620).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBecause of the fact the brother would skip on either one side or both sides every so often when doing a large print job that was in duplexing mode, and because jams forced you to unplug the printer to clear it (even when there really was no jam or the printer still decided it was jammed when the jam was removed), and because custom paper was non intuitive and could only be accepted from the back feeder I gave it a two stars instead of 4 or 5.\n\nSuffice it to say I opted to return this printer for a full refund and used that refunded money to purchase an Epson workforce 7620.  While the speeds aren't quite as fast as the brother (especially using color printing) and while the ink is a bit more expensive the trade off of better quality prints, more intuitive screens, not having to rotate paper based on size in the printer tray, and I would assume paper will not skip when doing large print jobs (though I will only know this for sure when I do my next newsletter on it which requires lots of duplexed copies) for these reasons I would highly recommend that you ditch this printer and opt for the Epson workforce 7620 as compatible ink is reasonable and all around it seems like a better quality, more sturdy printer all around.\n\nThanks, Amazon for your quick turn around time for printer replacements and for your willingness to ship the printer before you get the returned product (WITHOUT HOLDING MONEY CAPTIVE TILL THE BAD PRINTER IS RETUREND) HINT HINT BROTHER CUSTOMER SUPPORT !!!.\n\nAnyway I love amazon but do not like this printer or brothers return policy, I don't know what Epsons return policy is but I would guess it is more friendly than brothers.", "summary": "I was glad that I didn't go this route because brother would ...", "unixReviewTime": 1421020800}

You will need to extend the pad about 2 inches to the left of the keyboard. On a standard keyboard you will then have ~ 2 inches of unused space by the numpad. On a 10-keyless, it will extend the keyboard about 2 inches on each side. There is also an annoying crunching sound when touched (probably because the gel insert has some kind of plastic wrapping around it inside). For gaming, it doesn't really matter because you only use WASD and perhaps numpad/arrows, so it can be moved to the right for this task.\n\nThe 3m product at 18-19 inches would be better, as it doesn't make noise, has a rubber exterior which is easier to clean, is much softer, and doesn't have any contour.\nWould be nice if this was scaled down to work on a 10-keyless setup.\n\nEdit:\nI noticed that the bottom seam comes apart (it's just adhesive holding it together), and there is a sort of plastic membrane wrapped around a bunch of white gel/glue like stuff.

I especially love the pink Jotter and have had a number of them, which eventually get lost. So I ordered a few more recently. I was really disappointed when one of them started having trouble \"clicking\" open and closed. I unscrewed the pen and found the inside of the barrel filled with ink. What a mess! I refuse to put it in my purse...just leave it on my desk. It still works, and so far the ink hasn't leaked out of the pen, but I can't click it open and closed easily. It's all gummed up inside. So I ordered another for my purse. Guess what! Now, it's leaking, too! Barrel full of ink. Luckily, it didn't leak out into my purse. Boy, would I have been mad. What gives, Parker? Really disappointed!!! I want to give this pen five stars, and I would if it didn't leak, but as it is, it's a dud.\n\nUPDATE: I contacted Parker, and they very cheerfully offered to replace my two pens. They said their ink refills have a shelf-life and surmised that these pens may have been old. They didn't have any pink pens in stock, so they let me choose an alternate color. I am extremely pleased with the way Parker handled my problem.\n\nUPDATE: 2015: I've discovered that if you store these pens with the colored barrel end UP, they will begin to leak. I surmise that the original seller had the box of pens upside down for a while, which caused the leakage, as there were several of us who had this problem.

I have seen Susan Winget's designs in household goods and needlework for years and was really happy to find a coloring book filled to the brim with her designs.\n\nThe book is called Doodle House and it appears to be a glimpse at Ms. Winget's sketchbook.  The designs are hand-drawn and have the charming less than perfect look I expect from hand-drawn.  I think that it makes coloring them more interesting and I am enjoying this book quite a bit.\n\nTwo things that I really like about the construction of the book are the spiral binding and the hard covers.  The binding makes it easy to open the book to a flat position for coloring.  It also makes it easy for leftys to color with the same easy as rightys.  The hardcover gives a good flat surface for coloring on the go.\n\nThere are many designs with sayings as well as birds, animals and flowers.  While it is not a book dedicated to the natural world, many of the designs lean that way.  The designs are quite detailed but not what I would call intricate with tiny spots to color.  As I mentioned  previously, the hand-drawn nature of the artwork does show less than perfect.  There are disconnected lines, a bit of uneven spacing, and even lines of varying thickness.  It is that which gives it the sketchbook quality.\n\nThis is what I found while coloring in this book and testing my coloring medium on the paper:\n\n100 Design pages featuring hand-drawn artwork by Susan Winget with a focus on nature\n\nDesigns are printed on one side of the page\n\nPaper is medium weight, white, slightly rough and perforated\n\nDesigns do cross over the perforations but stop short of the spiral binding.  If you remove pages from the book, the edge that you will lose does not contain essential elements of the design.\n\nSpiral Binding with hard covers that help the book lay flat and provide a good coloring table\n\nAlcohol-based markers bled through the paper lightly.  I was surprised at how little bled through given that the paper is more medium in weight.  I would still use a blotter of card stock to protect the designs below my working page when using these style of markers.\n\nWater-based markers, gel pens and India ink pens did not bleed through or leave shadows on the back of the page.\n\nColored pencils worked well with this paper.  It has a good tooth and allowed for applying layers of the same color to get rich pigment.  I could also layer multiple colors well and I could blend both oil and wax based pencils easily with a pencil style blending stick.", "summary": "100 coloring pages with Susan Winget's cute style  printed one side of the page", "unixReviewTime": 1483315200}

However, with the D1788-2, this is not the case.  Even if there is no power you can still make phone calls using the base set.  That's a huge plus for anyone who lives where there are occasional power outages due to falling tree limbs, storms, or general power failure.\n\nYou can also dial in to your answering system from any touch phone when away from home after programming the phone with a security code of your choosing.\n\nNot much to do to prepare the phones for use.  Plug the base set into an AC electrical outlet using the provided adapter and to a telephone jack using the provided cord and attach the handset to the base with the provided cord; put the provided rechargeable batteries in the charging units for the two cordless phones and plug the chargers into electrical outlets using the provided cords.  Now the phones are ready to use as well as to program following the menu in the users guide.\n\nPretty much intuitive, but good instructions are in the manual.\n\nProgramming the phone is not difficult.  You have the choice of programming each phone separately or by clicking on the global menu option to program all 3 phones with date and time, etc, at the same time.\n\nThe user guide that comes with the phone is relatively small.  If you prefer something larger, google Uniden D1788 User Guide and you will get a larger PDF version which you can print or read on your computer monitor.  I found it easier to use this version to focus on what I was trying to accomplish.\n\nThe phones are good looking, especially the base phone.\n\nThe Uniden D1788-2 is a good wireless phone package at a good price.

The industry considers 5% sheet coverage with text to be a standard printed sheet which is the equivalent of only a medium length paragraph of text.\n\nI got 840 prints out of the starter cartridge that came with the printer so I am interested to see how long this one lasts.", "summary": "so good on the first cartridge", "unixReviewTime": 1416355200}

This will ensure that I have one at all times for work and school. It was a bit longer than I was expecting (I'll try to post a pic to show in the customer images) about 3.8 inches long, but it's long enough to write with comfortably and short enough to be carried. So you don't have to keep it on a keyring and it would work fine just sitting in your pocket or coin pocket if you don't like having it on your key ring. The cartridge itself is very well made and so is the outside case. You can really tell how thick it is when you take it apart and I don't think you'll have any problems with leakages. It is not as hard to pull off as some have said, although I am a little above average strength, but still what do you expect with something that's made to go on a key ring?", "summary": "Great EDC Pen", "unixReviewTime": 1377734400}

I found it very ungainly, a pain to move around, and it simply took up way too much space. I couldn't fit it under my computer screen like it advertised and can't imagine it working that way unless your screen could go very high.  So I have it off to the side of my screen; which is less than ideal but works.\n\nThe second thing that really annoyed me was when I tried to turn the pages. There is a lip on the front of the black base that prevented me from turning the pages easily.  I had to physically lift up the book and turn the pages so that they wouldn't scrape and start to tear on the lip. You wouldn't run into this issue if you are using loose-sheet pages instead of a book like I was, so it depends on what you are planning on using this for.\n\nThat being said, there are some really great things about this. I love how the legs can pivot so you can stand it up straight or you can lean the book back. That was a REALLY nice feature.  I also loved how you could move it up and down and at basically any level that you wanted. That was another huge plus.

Whenever I get anything digital, I always worry I won't be able to figure it out, but this is really easy to use. You can use it as-is or put in your own memory card, which is what I like to do. Then you turn it on, you choose what kind of film it is (slide, negative, 35mm, etc.), then you decide if you want to save it. It's that easy. There are other otpions and I need to read the instructions more, but I've been perfectly happy with what I've been doing so far. It also will flip the image over (if you put the negative or slide in upside down or backwards). It's really handy and very simple to get the hang of it.\n\nThen after I copied several pictures, I took the memory card out and put it in the little device I have to transfer it into my computer and played with the photos in Picasa (which you can google and download for free - for anyone who doesn't have Photoshop or anything like that), and I really had fun cropping and brightening old photos.\n\nIn the past when I used to always use a 35mm camera, as it got older it did not always take the best pictures. And sometimes when I would get a roll of film developed I would notice a picture in the negatives that they didn't print for me. I asked them once why that happens and they said it was because maybe the picture was too dark, or perhaphs over-exposed and too bright and it wouldn't come out good. But now with this device I can go and see what those \"lost\" photos are like. I have to say, I have been finding quite a few that to me definitely are worth having. Just because someone at the photo booth didn't think it was worth it doesn't mean it isn't a picture I would want. I put 2 examples above in the images near the product image if you want to see what I mean.\n\nOne picture was at the end of the roll and you can see where the film was ending and getting light exposure or whatever when it was time to take the film out of the camera. But these days with digital technology it was so easy for me to crop off the top of the picture and then just tweak the light a little to make it a little better quality. It's not the best photo as far as quality goes, but this brings back a memory of this day that I had forgotten, and I just love that.\n\nThe other picture they never developed for me is one that I am so happy to have. I had never seen this before and if I didn't have this Wolverine Converter, I would never have known this was on my negatives. Again, it seems a bit over-exposed, but I am so happy to have this. Our cat recently passed away, at 17 years old, and seeing this picture of him when he and my daughter were both younger just makes me smile. And to think, I would have missed this totally just because the person who developed my film thought it was not worth developing.\n\nI eventually stopped using my old 35 mm camera and now I have a digital one. But all the boxes of old pics I have, I can now take the negatives and check them out to see if there are any surprise photos like these or sometimes you give pictures away even though you don't have doubles, and then you just forget about it. So this is a fun and very handy item to have. So often I would want to get copies of pictures made, but just never bother. Now I can do it whenever I want.\n\nThe only down side of this converter to me was that the cord is so short. I had to get an extension cord to use it. But I am enjoying using it so much that the cord is not too much of an issue. So I have to give this five stars because I love photos and memories and this really has been great. Now to get some old slides from my mother-in-law to get some pics of my husband when he was little. It's like all these memories that would otherwise just be lost are now right at our fingertips. Things like that just really make me so excited and happy. If you are like that too, then you will really be happy with this converter.\n\nP.S. I have tried uploading the cropped and fixed versions of my 2 photos a few times, but for some reason, they are just not showing up.

The edges of the board of made of lightweight aluminum so there won't be a lot of weight on the wall when it is hanging up.  The board comes with 5 multi colored push pins and 5 multi colored thumb tacks.  The product features two sliding hooks at the top to mount it with and I love that they will adjust to where you need them to and are not stuck into one position.  I like the extra thought put into the designing of this board, one of my favorite features it the rounded corners made of plastic instead of the metal.  The company or designer was really looking out for our young ones with that design feature.  The back of the board is metal however it's too far from the front to be magnetic.\n\nThe only negative issue I have with it is that the description states that it's 16x12, the instructions in the box state that it is 15.8\" x 11.8\".  I measured it in the video and you can see for yourself the actual size if you are in question about that before purchasing.\n\nOverall this is a very nice bulletin board for small spaces and is offered at a decent price considering the quality and extra effort put into designing it.  Considering the only issue I can find is a discrepancy in description size I'm giving it a solid 5 Stars.\n\n*A sample of this product was provided to me free for testing and review.

I spent more time than necessary back then cleaning and soaking nozzles to try and get the things to print. I made my switch to Canon and never looked back until this came along.\n\nSo I've been using it daily, hammering away, and its been nothing short of amazing, especially in the paper handling area. Clean printing, fast outout that still looks sharp (draft mode used to be a JOKE with Epson), and a mechanically driven moving paper deck for DOUBLE SIDED PRINTING THAT IS FLAWLESS. I'm not kidding. I didn't expect that and I had actually wondered why this printer was up there in price when you can easily get AIO's for 89 bucks. The motorized paper handling deck works very well, and looks totally cool while it's \"performing\", lol.\n\nThe copy machine part also performed pretty near perfect. I copied several documents for my guitar students and almost couldn't tell the two apart. I don't use the fax segment, but both copy and fax are really a scan and then execute an output so there's no reason faxing should noty look good.\n\nPhoto printing: Canon added a very good feature that you see usually on the higher-end pro photo printers: besides the standard Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black cartridges, they included a Photo Black to handle certain types of photo paper media. Nice. I have that in my pro non-Epson 13x19 photo printers but to see it here makes this quite a viable unit to hammer out 4x6's to 8x10's.\n\nOK, last but very cool feature: device printing. I keep this printer connected to my PC at work, don't want it on the main wireless network nor do I want to share it. But I want to be able to print from my iPhone and iPad. Asking too much? NOPE, not with this unit. It creates its own wireless network and therefore you can print directly to it (I assume that means Android also, just have no way to test that). The LCD on the printer is a flip up color screen with menus to set everything up including the AirPrint network, or even print direct from your memory cards. Speaking of setting up, the driver and app software was an easy download from Epson's site, and it actually WORKED, quickly at that.\n\nOh, one more feature! This unit also does CD/DVD printing. I'm starting to think this printer is capable of writing my uncle in the Navy...\n\nOften when someone wants a home office AIO I steer them to Canons because I had given up years ago on Epson. But things have changed and the local wireless AirPrint network and the motorized dual-sided printing (and small footprint) makes this a new favorite.

I do love the variety of color and one household member quipped, I didn't know there were so many colors.\n\nThere are a wide assortment, including bright colors that seem to pop from the page when I use them. Theres no bleeding onto the paper or around the tips, something I dislike in cheap pens.\n\nEach set comes packaged in four separate trays, a dozen in each. When I was finished working (more like playing) with them, each pen nestled back into the tray easily. Im in the process of scouting out more permanent storage for them, but I do intend to keep them in the plastic trays.\n\nI found it quite easy to locate a particular color with this arrangement. Its quite easy to find a chosen color because both the pen caps and end caps have the same color as the ink.  Of course with the clear body of the pen, its easy to see the ink cartridge and its color.\n\nI used to have a craft box set up for my son, specifically for those rainy and sick days.

The third part is a warning about different kinds of plastics and the importance of choosing the right kind.\n\nUSING THESE 9 POCKET PAGES AS HOLDER FOR CARDS & COLLECTIBLES:\n\nI've worked in the antiques and collectible business for many years and Ultra Pro is the product all professionals and serious collectors use. They have different grades of pages, \"Silver\" (this item) being one of the better ones, specifically because it is \"non-pvc\" plastic (acid free). But all of Ultra Pro's products and pages hold up to regular use and are high quality. Ultra Pro's Platinum&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Card-Game-Supplies-Ultra-Pro-100-Nine-Pocket-Pages/dp/B00095M5DQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Card Game Supplies Ultra Pro 100 Nine-Pocket Pages</a>&nbsp;is slightly better (and more expensive) only because the plastic is a little thicker. If you don't plan on taking the items in and out of the page over and over and over then Silver is all you need.\n\nAlthough the description of this item states \"card game supplies\", 9 pocket top load pages are perfect for housing collectible trading cards of all kinds, including traditional sports cards (baseball, football, hockey, etc). Also good for Pokmon and similar cards.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nUSING THESE 9 POCKET PAGES FOR COUPONING, JEWELRY & CRAFT ITEMS:\n\nI tried using these pages to hold my coupons in a binder. I found the 9 pocket pages not to be practical for this. The reason is the pockets are a bit small for quick picking and gathering of coupons. When I want to get my coupons I don't want to have to struggle to get them. These pockets are made \"tight\" on purpose so the collectible cards don't easily fall out. Well, that \"tight\" fit also keeps your coupons in tight, and I found that makes them hard to retrieve easily and quickly. Also, most coupons are much larger than the cards these pages were made for, so if you want to put a coupon in the pocket you often have to fold the coupon. When you fold your coupon you cannot see all of the info on the coupon at a quick glance. And as any good couponer knows, accessing/picking, gathering, storing, and assessing/viewing your coupons quickly is important.\n\nI find the same problem when I tried to use these 9 pocket pages for small craft items and jewelry. I once tried to use these pockets so I cold display jewelry items in a binder, but it did not go well. If the item is something a bit bulky (like a piece of jewelry or crafting parts) then the \"tightness\" of the pocket (intended to keep cards from falling out) creates a problem holding jewelry and tiny craft parts. Although if you're going to house jewelry or craft items long term you really do want the non-pvc archival quality pockets. You just need to realize this size pocket is intended to hold one or two thin cardboard cards only, it really isn't intended for larger or thicker items. The pages will hold up, but the item (thicker or uneven craft item or jewelry) may not lay properly or fit well in the pocket.\n\nFor bulky items with odd shapes you should consider using hard plastic boxes. Make SURE they are the clear hard plastic type, not the pliable milky or opaque plastic because the milky or opaque usually are not archival qualit and are not good for long term storage, regardless of what they are marketed to be used for. How can you tell the difference? One way is to push on the box. If it has any give to it at all it most likely is not archival quality and is not to be used for long term storage for ANY item. If it is very hard, with no give, and is very clear (like glass) then most likely it is not acidic and will be okay for long term use. When it comes to food items there are numbers assigned to plastic containers. Some are more toxic than others. But the data from researchers and health & safety groups changes regularly so please see my note below about using plastic to hold food items and collectibles.\n\nBut if you insist on using pages in a binder I recommend larger pockets, even if the bulky item is very small, because you want to be able to get your fingers (at least 2 fingers and your thumb) in and out of the pocket, possibly deep at the bottom of the pocket, to retrieve the part or jewelry item easily. This is unlike taking a card out of the pocket, when the card can easily be accessed at the very top.\n\nFor couponing and other items that are not cards, I recommend 3 pocket pages.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/100-Pro-3-Pocket-Dollar-Currency-Collecting-Storage-Pages/dp/B003U61WUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">100 Pro 3-Pocket Dollar Currency Collecting Storage Pages</a>&nbsp;or 4 pocket pages.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/20-Twenty-Pages-BCW-Pro-4-Pocket-Page-3-5-X-5-Cards-Postcards-or-Photos/dp/B003AOG42Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">20 (Twenty Pages) - BCW Pro 4-Pocket Page (3.5 X 5 Cards, Postcards or Photos)</a>&nbsp;Four pocket pages are usually used to hold post cards and photos (do not use them for this reason unless they are non-pvc type). Three pocket pages are made for holding collectible paper money. Three pocket pages are usually not archival quality (because collectible paper money or \"notes\" are never place inside the 3 pocket page w/o first being housed in a archival sleeve) but that's okay because you really don't need archival acid free plastic for your coupons. Bottom line, you don't need non-pvc or expensive brand pages for your coupons. You just want pages that have good welds and won't tear. I've used both the 3 pocket and 4 pocket pages mentioned above and so far they are holding up fine. If I run into problems with them (if they tear) I'll be sure to update this review.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nABOUT PLASTICS FOR HOUSING COLLECTIBLES (and food):\n\nWhen using any pages or plastic holders to house collectible items it is extremely important to get what is called \"non-pvc\" acid free pages/plastic, or \"archival quality\" pages/plastic. The reason for this is that any other kind of plastic (softer polyethylene) for example, will eventually excrete an oily gaseous acidic chemical that will ruin your cards (or anything else you put in the pages) and make them worthless. This leeching of acidic chemicals takes time, months or years, but once it happens irreversible damage is done to the item.\n\nThe chemical found in pages that are NOT described as non-pvc is what allows the plastic to be pliable and soft. That's why non-pvc & archival quality plastics seem harder or crisper, less easily bendable; they don't have this acidic chemical that makes plastic pliable, or they have much less of it. This chemical is put in the plastic to help it bend and that chemical is what comes off the plastic over time (in a gas form) then attaches itself to the nearest thing - the item you placed in the pocket page. When the gas chemical attaches to the item it becomes sticky and slimy. This is extremely evident if the item you house is made of metal or hard plastic. After a while you can actually see a yellowish or green film on the item and you can feel the sticky slimy oily chemical. For paper or cardboard items you will notice a discoloration and possibly notice a slimy tacky feeling. Ether way the chemical is corrosive and as I said, ruins any thing it gets on. You can't really see it happening day to day because it's such a slow process. But it does happens and one day you'll go look at your collection and find it's discolored and ruined. Even if you try to clean the chemical damage off your item any professional will be able to see the damage with a loop, so you won't be able to clean the items and sell them to a dealer.\n\nSo, NEVER buy any plastic to hold collectible items or items you will house long term unless the plastic is described as \"non-pvc\" or \"archival\" quality. If the sleeve, page or bag is described as \"soft\" but does not specifically say it's \"archival quality\" then most likely it is NOT archival quality.\n\nAs a side note, this acidic corrosive chemical (pvc) is found to some degree in food grade plastic bags and pliable food containers. For this reason NO FOOD items should ever be held long term (more than a few weeks) in a soft plastic bag or pliable container and you should NEVER microwave your food in these containers. You also want to stay away from BPA containers when storing food and collectibles. BPA-free is best if you must use plastic for food storage.\n\nAll food grade plastics are assigned a number; 1 thru 7. With some believing 3 and 7 to be the worst. For more info on these numbers and what they mean please do an internet search for EcoVillageGreen or plastic recycling numbers. No plastic is really 100% safe for food items but BPA-free is the best. Please be sure to educate yourself on using plastics before you use them with food items.\n\nTo be safe, always use glass for long term food storage and microwaving.

You have the option to do so as you scan, but this slows down scanning. There's also a menu click which yields a list of scans awaiting OCR-- really nice touch!\n\n2) Unlike proprietary organizers, the \"cabinets\" created within the organizer software are actual directories on your hard disk. Likewise, folders created within the organizer's cabinets are subdirectories on your disk. So, you get the best of all worlds-- use the organizer knowing you're not locked in, as it's just a slick interface for what is actually existing on your drive. (i.e., Create a cabinet = create a directory)\n\n3) Thermal receipts, even trying-to-fade ones, come thru crisp and clear, miraculously, when scanning.\n\n4) I have Adobe Acrobat Professional 8, which is a necessary evil in my business. I can now avoid that bloated monster altogether when it comes to receipts and anything else I choose to scan using this system. That alone is worth the price of entry!\n\n5) The duplex scanning is wondrous-- paper goes thru only once, with both sides captured simultaneously -- speedily. This still blows my mind (I have a duplex Canon MP830 multifunction-- for all practical purposes, its scanner has been blown away by this device.)\n\n6) Let's face it-- sometimes, paper jams. This is the FIRST machine encountered-- since the late 80's when I started computing--  which makes it so easy to fix things. You just push the little square silver arrow atop the scanner, open, get the paper, and close it. Incredibly easy and no-fuss! And yes, the wrinkled paper then flows thru fine (I gently kept a finger on that one item as it scanned thru, just to be safe.) BTW, I had scanned upwards of 300 items before a jam occurred.\n\n7) Lots of options, re speed, resolution, etc. All easy to get to, all quick to implement. These folks actually used this thing during the creation process, as it seems they didn't miss a trick in making this a genuinely consumer friendly device!\n\n8) The consumables are comparatively cheap. The pad assembly (Part # PA03541-0002) needs replacement every 10,000 sheets or a year-- google the actual part # to see the $8 retailers); the pick roller (Part # PA03541-0001) lasts about 100,000 sheets-- about $12. I noticed a huge price variation among retailers while googling, so I placed my order today; they're not in stock at most places, but I have plenty of time so who cares. This is bound to be a profoundly popular scanner per word-of-mouth, and consumable prices may increase accordingly. BTW, right-click the ScanSnap Manager tray icon for \"check consumable supplies\" to get a tally on current sheet usage, which you can reset during the replacement process.\n\n9) Small footprint-- lives in a bookcase shelf atop my desk.\n\n10) One of the rare occasions where I've had absolutely no post-purchase regrets with an electronic item!\n\nLong and short of it is this: I've finally lived long enough to see one hardware manufacturer get everything right. There's a pdf manual, but I read it only to investigate consumables (thought it would be a \"gotcha!\" but was pleasantly suprised at the reasonable cost). I assume you're reading these reviews carefully (as I did), trying to decide between the ScanSnap and a lower priced alternative. For once, I decided not to play cheapskate, and boy oh boy, am I glad!! (The price here has already escalated a bit, so do it now, my friend!)", "summary": "A pure joy", "unixReviewTime": 1207094400}

If you need a printer at home, it is just practical to get one that can do everything.  The MX532 can print, scan, copy and send fax.\n\nThe most important to me is to print from my mobile devices.

It defaults to WPS configuration first so I had to canceI to make the printer look for an access point. Once I found my SSID, I started typing my password.  The manual didn't say clear how to input uppercase and number.  I keep pressing the key hoping it will cycle from lowercase to uppercase and then numbers.  It didn't work that way. You have to press the asterisk once to switch it to uppercase and then press asterisk again to do the numbers.\n\nInitially, my problem with the older MX522 is that sometimes I lose connection to the printer. I found out that when this happens I was not using the right SSID.  I have a guess WiFI network and sometimes my iPad or iPhone automatically connects to the Guess instead of the main WiFi network. The simple solution is to connect to the right SSID.  Rarely, but it happens too that I am on the right SSID but my device cannot find the printer.  Turning off and turning on the printer solves the problem.\n\nAirprint:\nMy Macbook Air and IOS devices immediately found the printer.  Now I have a selection of 520 or 530 series.

The pen loop is a great idea. I love that I can hook in a pen and keep it with my planner. Super convenient. Unfortunately, the included loop is way, way, way too small. Yes, you can stretch it out, but it's ridiculous the amount of effort this takes for certain pens. A great deal of the planner community uses multipens and those are really thick. No way will you be able to fit a five-color multipen into this pen loop right out of the box. I use fountain pens primarily, and many of mine are thicker than the average ballpoint or gel pen too.

The locking mechanism for the lever is unnecessarily difficult to figure out right away.  The plastic thing with the arrows on it slides to lock/unlock as the handle is held down.  This makes for a \"duh\" moment once it's figured out, but better instructions would make this simpler.  This lock seems to be only to make storage easier by lowering the profile on the lever.  The lever needs to be in the unlocked position to punch holes.\n\nThe tray that holds the punched paper is also awkward.  The idea is that the tray slides away from the main body, but it opens only about an inch.  Tipping the punch into a waste basket still makes the punched holes go where they should not, and it's difficult to get every last one out.  Prior to sliding the tray, make sure you bang and tilt the punch in the direction of the arrows to improve your chances of getting those paper bits as close to that one inch opening as possible.  THEN slide the tray open.\n\nDON\"T try to remove the plastic tray from the punch itself.  It's so easy to do accidentally, but very hard to put back.", "summary": "Punching Holes is Easy (But Instructions are Cryptic)", "unixReviewTime": 1397347200}

The only glitch I had with the Epson this time was that for some reason I was unable (at least at this point) to register the product.

I am very happy with the documents. Though the color photos are not, of course, as vivid as color laser output (the best color laser I ever had was an Okidata, but the replacement toner was outrageous), they are quite good.\n\nOne of the cool features of this product is the inability to directly email the printer. It also has the ability to print on both sides and is energy efficient. I also really liked that the cassette holds 500 pages.\n\nAnother thing to consider about Epson is that you get lifetime phone support if you have any issues, which you probably won't.

For some this is a pain, but I love that I can connect and power this thing with one USB3.0 cable.\n2. While it will scan without loading the drivers off the disk it will work better if you install the Canon drivers.  Canon has a lite version of their CaptureOnTouch software that can run directly off the scanner, however to enable all of the features you need to install the full drivers off the disk or download them from Canon (go to the product page on Canon and click on the Drivers and Software link.\n\nFunctionally it works well and will get the job done for a small office or home use.

Inkjets are a bit of a hassle but the quality can be spectacular.\n\nWhen I did the demo in the office supply store on the 1518ni I was just blown away buy the photographic quality print on normal office paper.  I had never seen such quality on a laser which usually has scan lines from the rotating laser head.  I read up a bit about HP's new \"color sphere\" toner which is the trick to making the whole system work.  The tonerparticles are much smaller than previous color toners allowing the print engine to mix 1, 2, or 3 of one color along with numerous specs of toner from the other cartridges  before heading to the fuser.  This gave the quality which was more than adequate for proofing, and could even be used on high grade paper for prints.  HP kept is simple on this product as well - there is a pull out drawer with the 4 toner cartridges (don't forget to peal off the seal on the toner or else nothing prints at all - there is a green tab you snap then pull out twice the width of the cartridge in sealing tape which has become a much cleaner process than previous toner loading.\n\nThere is a down side - I paid $130 for the printer on sale which included the card readers, usb memory card reader, lcd display, and wired networking which I consider a good value. The fact that I can use it from any CPU in the buildings is a definite win. BUT-  When the time comes to replace the printer cartridges (4 remember) at 80 bucks a pop, its $320 to print roughly 2000 sheets.  As a result I kept my laserjet monochrome printer for documents and only use the 1518ni printer when I want a quick print to show someone or to make a quick color document for a customer.\n\nAnd, as usual, HP gives you \"starter\" toner cartridges so your $320 investment will come sooner rather than later.  Beware of these $50 cartridges being sold as compatible also - they are much larger particle size and will not generate the spectacular color the genuine HP products will.  Sometimes HP has a sale on all 4 toners at once so you can watch hp.com for their pricing, and also sign up for their newsletter on ink and toner specials.\n\nFor the price I paid I was very impressed with the quality and simplicity of use.  I also have HP inkjet printers but every time I go to unclog the supplies I walk away with pink, yellow, blue, and of course black fingers.  This printer stays on my network in its energy star mode ready to print on a moments notice,  Speed is impressive as well.  If HP ditched the whole \"starter cartridge\" concept I'd be alot happier camper, but again the price was right.", "summary": "Simple to use, no clogged nozzles, photo quality laser color", "unixReviewTime": 1277078400}

The G2 Pro is sufficiently professional looking for most offices, still has a good heft to it, and has a grip that's padded -- but not excessively (to my tastes).\n\nSo I guess the choice comes down to how much weight, how much padding, and how much eye appeal you're looking for.  As I mentioned, I've used G2 pens for years and never had one break on me -- I'm still using some on their 3rd and 4th refill.  So, tough to go wrong with them!

I had a much more expensive fountain pen already, and this one was specifically for keeping at my desk at home.\n\nBut then I got to using it and, while I was unimpressed with the appearance (simple, matte black) it was the kind of understated product I do prefer. It wouldn't qualify as \"elegant\", but it is more attractive than I expected.\n\nAs to the use of the pen; the more I use it, the more pleased I am. It came with both a plate press cartridge (refillable via ink bottle; the thing people who don't use fountain pens picture) and a replaceable ink cartridge. Being that it's still primarily for practice I use the cartridges for the sake of simplicity, and have not had the opportunity to test the plate press. When I do, I'll update this review.\n\nThe lines have been smooth and easy, the nib is sturdy and doesn't catch, and the weight of the pen is on the heavy side, but easy to use for hours at a time.\n\nRegarding the ink, I ordered a pack of Pilot/Namiki IC-100 cartridges, and it took me several dozen pages to exhaust the first of them. The ink does not dry in or on the nib in such a way as to cause any difficulty, and I've only had to clean the tip of dried ink once, when I left the pen sitting for several days without use. Of course those who use fountain pens will know this is a no-no, but if this is your first such pen then try to make sure you get the ink flowing (write!) every couple of days at the least. That said, clean-up was simple and took less than 5 minutes. Pilot includes clean-up instructions in the box.\n\nI'm not an expert calligrapher or fountain pen enthusiast. I bought this product because, simply, it was recommended by Amazon with the penmanship guide I was purchasing the same day, and I have been increasingly pleased with that decision every day since.", "summary": "The pen I didn't want to love.", "unixReviewTime": 1528675200}

One of the more reasonable film digitizers. (Still pretty pricey considering its construction and glitches.)\n2. Images from negatives look great to me. It has settings for b/w and color and outputs very high res.  (Haven't tried slides yet.)\n3. Portable. You don't have to hook it up to a computer to use it so you can sit anywhere next to an outlet and scan. (Needs an extension cord as the provided one is short.)\n4. Settings to adjust, flip and turn the negatives though if your doing many its faster to just adjust them in photo editing software later.\n5. Quick scanning. Couple of seconds for each negative in the strip.\n\nNEITHER PRO NOR CON\n1. Digitizes  \"typical\" 35mm film and 110 only. Larger negatives, which I have quite a few, will not work.\n2. Holds a strip of 6 35mm negatives.\n\nCONS\n1. Trays are hard to open and tricky to line up the little nibs to the film if you have less than a full strip of six negatives.\n2. Some 35mm film, possibly from instant cameras, don't line up with the dividers on the tray. So those have to be move adjusted for each single frame. (I uploaded a photo.)\n3. Extra trays are very pricy though nice to have a couple to speed up scanning a lot of negatives.\n4. Does NOT do 126 negatives. I have no idea why they don't make a tray for those. My husband made me one with cardboard that works great to use for this format with this scanner.\n5. Other machine auto adjust the color and contrast after you put a negative or slide in. I've had quite a few color negatives not auto adjust right and come in VERY light though the negative is fine. Not sure why this is. I can usually adjust them in my editing software after I scan but that is the one glitch that bothers me at least on the one I purchased.\n\nTHOUGHTS\nTaking into consideration there not many choices for standalone inexpensive film scanners that have decent ratings, this one works fine overall for what I wanted which was a portable digitizer with a card and preview screen. I've scanned a few hundred negatives already and find it adequate for my needs.\n\nHaving an inexpensive light board is incredibly useful when working with negatives in general and makes loading these tray much easier when it's done on top of the board as shown in my photos I uploaded.\n\nNOTE: To see my images you have to click below the main item graphic where it says \"See all Customer Images\" They do not show default. :-(\n\nFOLLOWUP June 28 2013\nI have now scanned thousands of negatives... black and white and color 35 mm and a few slides. Also 110 negatives.  I love this thing even with its minor glitches. As I have literally thousands of negatives and slides to scan in I do many of them laying propped up on my bed scanning while I watch TV. The portable factor of this scanner is off the charts wonderful for me.  I recommend this to anyone wanting a overall inexpensive scanner that does the job for home negatives.

In the old BJ's that was a constant problem and I had all kinds of special Canon cannisters to prevent the ink from drying up, which never worked very well.\n\nI had an issue when I first set it up. The instructions say to remove the \"film\" from the print head.  Well, it turns out the translation of \"film\" is a bit weird. By film, they mean the orange, hard plastic container type thing that you have to snap the print head out of. To me that is hardly \"FILM\".  So I struggled to remove the shiny brown thin film like stuff on the bottom of the print head, only to learn that that was not what they meant and wound up destroying the print head!\n\nI called Canon and they were truly great.

The 7620, 7610, and 7110 are wide-format printers, handling up to 13x19 paper, with two-sided printing or faxing up to 11x17 paper. The 7610 holds 250 sheets while the 7620 holds 500 sheets of paper. The 7110 model is like the 7620, eliminating the all-in-one aspects, and printing but without fax or scan capacity.\n\nUnpacking and setup both went smoothly as I connected the printer to my wifi network, entering my password on the printer's keypad. I was then quickly able to access the printer's IP address from my Mac laptop and upgraded the firmware to the latest version - not a necessity, but figured for the review I should use Epson's latest. There was no need to use the included CD-ROM as my desktop and laptop Macs (running OS 10.9.4) both saw the printer and could utilize it without difficulty.\n\nI compared this printer to the new Epson WF-3640, which is roughly the same unit but with only letter sized paper. What I said in my review for that unit applies here as well: The printer copies, scans, faxes, prints, connects directly to SD or MS Duo cards, prints two-sided (significantly faster than older units, where there was a time delay while print on one side dried), prints from your iPhone, and probably more. Everything works, and works quickly without a lot of wasted time. I still find the output of a monochrome laserwriter to be just a little cleaner than inkjet output, but this inkjet is about on a par with a color laser unit, the output from which often appears just a little blurry compared to a monochrome unit's. This is meant as a workplace unit - the ink combination isn't the best for photographs, so if that's a key plan of yours, look to another printer (Epson and Canon both have good offerings here). But for a work plan cover sheet, or a bio that includes a head shot, this will do just fine. That's to say it's perfectly acceptable for photographs that aren't being viewed for their artistic quality.\n\nI have no quibbles with this unit. Obviously, if you're not going to print 13x19\" or 11x17\" pages, and have no need for faxing or copying that size paper, there's no need to get this unit as it will be larger than your needs. But it's wonderful to occasionally be able to print poster-sized pages for posting at work or school.\n\nThere is a small setup worksheet that accompanies the printer. A 333 page full owner's manual is easily accessed online and will answer any specific questions you have about the product or its use.", "summary": "Excellent Wide-Format Printer", "unixReviewTime": 1406505600}

One day a few months ago it simply failed to connect, and a new computer and network later I STILL can't get it to print. It's ridiculous that something as simple as connecting to a wireless network would make an otherwise good product no more useful that a paper weight.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI Love this printer, but it looses a star for the difficult setup. I am a fairly tech savvy individual and it still took me 2 hours to set this up with reading through the reviews. The quick setup instructions are essentially useless. A couple of tips before I comment on the actual printer. Taking the previous reviewer's advice you will definitely have to upgrade the firmware on this. You must first set up the printer with the manual wireless setup. After that you will be able to print wirelessly. If you then want to do the wireless direct to print from your phone you must then upgrade the firmware, THEN go back to the first set up disk and do a direct wireless setup. Having to basically set up the printer TWICE is where I got stuck in the process. From then on, it works flawlessly.\n\nThe printer itself is great! I got it at a steal from a big box store, which made it even more worthwhile. It is compact, and the design allows me to store it under my (elevated) bed rather than use precious surface space in my small apt. The auto duplexing is a dream and the print quality is spectacular. I have printed images on the brother laser printer and this and this definitely wins. Even fine graphics (pwpt notes slides) print with clarity. I have also been able to print from my phone with ease, however, I have a Samsung phone so I can't speak to the compatibility of other systems.\n\nAnother point, which was something that I ran into when doing my research on different models was what exactly is the difference between the\nSL-M2830DW  and the SL-M2835DW models. The only difference between the two is this model (2830) combines the drum and toner) the 2835 has a 2 piece unit (toner and imaging unit) which is supposed to reduce the cost per page. However, the toner cost is about the same regardless of the printer model. With the imaging unit, having  a life of 9k pages you're gonna be coughing up an extra $40 for every 4th toner replacement. Ultimately, I don't think I'll print enough to break even with the 2 piece unit so I went with this model. Also at the time of purchase this model was about half the cost of the 2835.", "summary": "Setup is frustrating, but ultimately worth it.", "unixReviewTime": 1422489600}

Works like a charm. Gobbles up the pages at about 1 per second and scans both sides and no matter how many pages you load, a few seconds after it scans the last page, a thumbnail view shows up on your screen of all pages. You can have it then do character recognition or not. I have scanned a couple of thousand pages by now and I had 4 misfeeds. Three were because I overlooked stapled pages. The sound sensor detects the crumbling of paper during a misfeed and quickly turns off the feed motor so your page is not shredded. Very small footprint, very intelligent design. The scanner manual is probably in the top 2% of well written manuals that I have ever seen. Clear, logical, photos, arrows detail, hyperlinked.\n\nMy only gripe is that there is no documentation for the software and although it is easy to load and works flawlessly, it took quite some time to figure out exactly how to use it. You have to first create \"Driver Profiles\" that contain the options that you want. Then you create scanner profiles and select other options that you want and select a driver profile to go along with it. The combinations are endless. Color only. B&W only. Auto color recognize. Various resolutions. OCR or not? Pdf or jpeg? Their PaperStream software is brand new and there is already a newer version on their website to download. There are options in the software for things I have never heard of, and evidently would only be useful in an enterprise environment.\n\nI contacted Fujitsu twice and got English speaking people answering the phone who were knowledgeable and polite. I must be dreaming. I highly recommend this product. Very satisfied, but ouch it is costly.\n\n1/21/2014 Update: Just finished scanning 5000 pages since I bought it. I believe there were only 2 misfeeds that were my fault (forgetting to remove a staple). It has now told me that it is now scheduled for its 5000 page cleaning so I called Fujitsu to ask a question about that, a very nice ENGLISH speaking person answered and told me that I really do not need to pay for the cleaner and pads specified in the manual, just use isopropyl alcohol greater than 90%. I did, worked fine, saved money. ANOTHER positive interaction w Fujitsu. Then I went into the software to reset the counter for cleaning to \"0\" so that it will let me know in another 5000 pages. There are other page counters that will let you know when it may be time for replacement of different feed rollers, and then there is a global page counter that cannot be reset. I am very impressed.\n\nWhat is interesting is that I originally performed my research and settled on the HP Scanjet Flo 7000 which is also a new model and has very similar features. I ordered it directly from HP and the shipping date kept getting pushed back, and back. I kept calling and emailing Hp to ask for a realistic shipping date. They kept giving me different excuses such as, \"I tried contacting the warehouse and I can't get through\", then \"I sent an email to the warehouse to ask and they have not responded\", then it was \"there was a large rain storm that knocked out the electricity and the servers are down and it won't be until tomorrow when they come up.\" Delays, lies at Hp caused me to cancel the order and go with the Fujitsu Fi-7160. I could not be happier with how things worked out. Interestingly, in the last month I noticed Fujitsu scanners at hospitals and other large corporations that I have been in, not HP.\n\n5/18/2017 Update\nStill amazed how wonderful the scanner is. Flawless. Never jams, unless I forgot to remove a staple. I decided to upgrade to the newest version of Paperstream software since I was still using version 1.0 from 3 years ago. Easily went to the Fujitsu website, easy download, easy install. Unfortunately, all the scan profiles I had created with Version 1.0 were not carried over, so I had to recreate them... I half expected that to happen. Glad to see that the usability of the software is greatly improved from the 1st version. The right click Adhoc feature lets you change any part of a profile for just one scan, very cool. So a couple days after I created my 8 scan profiles, I opened up the program and they were all GONE! Not happy. I remembered my great experience the last time I called customer support, so I decided to try that again, although I was truly expecting that they went the way of everyone else and now contract their customer service out to a company in Siberia. Amazing, went through one phone menu, was on hold for 20 seconds, and my call was answered by a real, live, native English speaking ADULT. And he was fully competent and was able to solve my issue immediately. Another great experience. Thank you Fujitsu.\n\n3/5/2018 Update\nThis baby is still cranking. FLAWLESS. I hope Fujitsu will consider making cars. :-)", "summary": "This is a great product", "unixReviewTime": 1389657600}

For many years I had an Apple LaserWriter Plus 630 and an Epson or HP color ink jet printer. Most of what I print can be in B&W and the LaserWriter would do a great job and quick too. Ink jets can give great color prints but they are so slow and the ink is always running out since it uses so much of it to prime itself or clean the print head. I've grown to hate them. If you print a high volume of color prints then you'll get many more pages out of the ink but for someone who only prints a small volume of pages more of the ink is used up priming when the printer is turned on and used for unclogging the print head.\n\nSo my reliable and very long time LaserWriter finally developed bad issues in the electronics and wouldn't work sometimes. So I had to find a printer solution that best met my needs which was B&W and low volume color printing, and reliable and low maintenance. This HL4040CN is what I bought for that and it's been awesome. Sure it doesn't print photo grade color but the positive trade off is that I get very fast and reliable color printing and the color looks beautiful. Some complain about the colors not being so true and I assume they are Windows users printing with the default color setting whereas Macs have a built-in color matching system ColorSync which calibrates the colors and makes a very nice improvement on the color tone.\n\nThe size is BIG. I'm used to that since I've used full sized office network laser printers which I've found to be rugged and reliable as opposed to the small home grade laser printers which can be temperamental and break more easily. This HL4040CN looks very ruggedly built like my past 3 LaserWriters all of which lasted a very long time and I hope that this one will to.\n\nEnvelope feeding is the one minor annoying thing with this printer. You have to pop the back cover open and adjust 2 levers for the thicker stock and then it works perfectly. Instructions are in the manual for how to set this.", "summary": "Reliablle Color and Calibrates to Mac ColorSync", "unixReviewTime": 1321056000}

The cap threads on, opposed to friction fit, and is very nice for keeping ink fresh and ready to flow when you're ready.\n\nNoodler's inks work great in all my fountains, wide color selection, and downright fun.\n\nfwiw: When I bought the Pilot Prera, I also purchase the Pilot Penmanship Fountain Pen. This is for penmanship training, with a 3-sided grip to help learn proper pen holding.

Packaging tape is one of those things. We always bought 3m's Scotch tape, despite being continuously frustrated by it's performance. And I can tell you that yes, sometimes, the grass really is greener on the other side, and we'll be buying Zitriom LLC's packing tape from here on out!\n\nTo start, Zitriom's tape thicker than the Scotch brand tape, considerably so. And while that doesn't sound like much, not only does it make it stronger, but it also means it's not going to just flop over and stick to itself, or to something unintended as so often the case with the Scotch brand tape. It also stayed stuck. Which sounds like a \"Well, duh!\" statement, but until you've tried to secure boxes with tape that won't stay stuck on, don't \"Duh!\" me! The tape we've been using was always a crapshoot as to whether it'd stay stuck on things, and that will make you want to rip your hair out after a few failures. Zitriom's tape stayed put, period. The one thing that I didn't care for was the dispenser. Having used a \"Tape Gun\" now for a couple of decades, I found the dispenser flimsy, awkward and for me, dangerous. Maybe it was me, maybe I'm out of practice, but I tossed it almost immediately and stuck the Zitriom tape in my gun and never looked back. So look at the dispenser as a \"Value Added\" thing and not a make-or-break item in the set.\n\nYou get 6 rolls of premium packaging tape (each roll is 1.90\" x 55 yards) for $10.98, which is almost 20% less than the closest version of the Scotch brand tape. It's not heavy duty, but it's plenty thick and I found it to be better than the 3M tape I was using, so I was happy with Zitriom's version of this and will buy it again when I need tape.\n\nI received the above product(s) free of charge from Zitriom LLC. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.

What is really nice is that it is a full strip stapler meaning that it will take a full strip of staples instead of having to break a strip up to fit into the stapler.

It works with the standard staples that I have but then of course, they aren't high capacity so they will only handle a small amount of papers.

I thought I was getting regular 8.5 x 11 sheets like previous labels I've ordered. These are small 4 x 6 sheets that I can't print with my current printer. Like all Avery labels I've tried so far, they are a very nice quality of paper and adhesive. The Avery website has easy to use templates, but they are limiting in some ways. I usually put the dimensions in Word and create my own template so I can use my artwork for certain homemade items.

This calendar is flip style with the wire coil at the top, and a metal rod within the coil that allows hanging the calendar without it tearing through the paper. like the cheaply made calendars do.  I also appreciate that there are no stupid pictures I have to look at every day, just full size lined squares to write in the information I need.  The bottom edge of the calendar has all twelve months listed so you don't have to flip through the calendar to see what day is on what date.  The only thing I caution about is using certain permanent markers that will bleed through the paper and mark on the succeeding sheet, so I recommend only using gel-style pens or something that won't soak through the paper.  Each date has a small \"running total\" of days elapsed and days to come for the yearly 365 days, and all the major holidays are listed, plus some other ones that I never even heard of.  The more major holidays have the date in red.  I think these are federally-celebrated holidays.  This is not a small calendar, filling a 23\" by 15.5\" space on my kitchen wall.  But a good 80% of the calendar can be used for recording information, as opposed to the less-than-50% of calendars that have the top half as a pretty picture.  A lot cheaper price here on Amazon than at the local office supply store, as is usually the case with Amazon.

I used no cables, no programming, but I move the memory chip to where I want the scanned information, up to the 4000 copies that an 8 gig chip will hold. it takes at least 3 seconds to a copy, & at least 3 seconds to set up each page. It is free of frustration, convenient & portable.  Just be careful when opening the package, it could slide out onto the floor when you open the package.", "summary": "Very Portable scanner", "unixReviewTime": 1361923200}

I always wanted a scanner that could handle larger size graphics but couldn't afford the high cost, until this one came along. It makes great scans and is fast and easy to use. Scan quality is excellent and I am surprised by how fast it actually scans a full color page. The software and drivers installed with no problem on my Windows XP machine (an old one at that) and it co-exists with my Microtek scanner with no issues. It comes with a very basic control panel that lets you scan or copy directly, but this is really not the way to use this machine. Instead, if everything is installed properly, you launch the scanner through the TWAIN option in your image processing software, make some basic settings in the menu that pops up and then scan directly into the image program. I use Photoshop Elements and it put the Mustek scanner into its TWAIN (import) menu with no problem. The scanner has preview and final scan functions. You can resize the scan frame to suit the size of the material being scanned and there is a batch scan option also.\n\nThere are some things you need to be aware of when installing this machine. It is very lightweight and will scoot around the worktable when you open the lid and position the paper to be scanned. It needs to be placed up against something heavy. Second, the USB cable must be plugged direcly into the USB port on the back of the computer. I tried going though a powered USB hub but the computer could not find the scanner. This tip is on the Mustek website. Third, the scanning program that opens through TWAIN is very basic and unsophisticated. As far as I could tell, Silverfast does not make a compatible version. You just have to handle most of your adjustments through your photo editing software such as Photoshop.\n\nOverall, this scanner handles the basic chores with no problems and won't break your bank account.", "summary": "Great Scans and Easy to Use", "unixReviewTime": 1268524800}

I wanted to share some information on putting this item together that might be helpful to others.  First, the two half-round black plastic pieces that have to be put together around each corner for each shelf and the handle do not fit together perfectly nor do they need to as it turns out--something I wish I had known beforehand.  Surprisingly enough, these plastic pieces will be covered (but not completely) by the shelf/handle providing a nice sturdy base for the shelf or handle. That was certainly not apparent when I started putting this together.  Also, make sure you are putting these two pieces together and on the pole right.  Each half has \"top\" marked on one end, but the word is embossed in the plastic which doesn't stand out greatly.\n\nNext, there is no clear indication where exactly these plastic pieces go on the pole.  I found that if I put the pieces together up a little higher than needed, pressed them into one another and slid them down the pole, they made a clearly heard and felt snapping sound so that you know they are in place.\n\nLast, slide the shelf on gently and make sure the black plastic sleeves are all going inside the shelf holes.  Just barely get them started so that all sides will go down smoothly once you are sure all the plastic sleeves are in place.\n\nMaybe I'm an idiot, but I couldn't tell which way the bottom shelves went on--side pieces up as a mini tray or down. If I had come to the site I would have seen \"up\" like a mini tray was the answer by looking at the photo.  The drawing included does not clearly show it, however.  There is also writing on the corners which is right side up this way--dead give away, so, okay, I am an idiot.\n\nOverall I'm impressed with the quality of the materials. The cart is quite sturdy in an industrial chic kind of way. If you are looking for a delicate-looking piece, this is not the one for you.  I saw that there are some grayish plastic inserts that can be purchased separately if you want to prevent things from falling through the holes in the shelves. That would really take away from the look for me.  If I find I need something, I will have glass or plexiglass cut for it.  At this point, I am using it as my coffee bar and have nothing that will fall through.\n\n I saw some reviews mentioning product damage on arrival.  Mine was in perfect shape.  It was well packed with one box inside another for extra protection.  All pieces were included and in perfect condition. I was able to easily put this together by myself despite the less than ideal directions.\n\nIf I didn't feel a need to prevent others from some initial confusion as they push those plastic pieces together only to find that that other side separates, I'd give this five stars.", "summary": "A few hints for putting this together....", "unixReviewTime": 1466035200}

Another annoyance is that you have to turn the scanner off to disconnect the scanner from the computer, or to get back to the main screen after using the scanner.  If your images require color correction, you have to do them one at a time, which isn't much of an issue if you have a computer and photoshop, but if the intent of the machine was to bypass the computer, it's not very convenient.\n\nThere are flatbed scanners out there, designed to scan slides and film at extremely higher resolutions.  They take much longer, but the quality is exceedingly better.\n\nThis product appears to specifically target people who want to make smallish (4x6) prints or to display on a TV screen, and that's it.

In my experience, the only reason to remove a label would be because of an incorrect address - thus it would be destroyed.  Other than compulsive personalities, I've no idea the need for these.\n\nOther thoughts and finds: while I didn't do an in depth comparison, I quickly found a website selling both RE-HESIVE and PERMANENT - the re-hesive label was slightly more in cost than the original permanent stick label.\n\nAfter pulling off and removing 3 times, the edges did start to curl and the label adhered to the envelope at my desk, but I fear it would not have made it through any abusive transit system.  Anything could catch an curled corner edge and tear it off.\nLastly, these are noted as being GUARANTEED SMUDGE PROOF - well be sure to purchase appropriate labels for injet vs laser printing.  The inkjet labels DID smudge after printed in my laser printer.\n\nAll in all - if, in the past, you've ever wanted to remove a label and re-use it, then I suppose you would love to use these.  I've been in business over 10 years and my thoughts are:\nI have no need for this type of label.

The colors are very waxy and often \"skip\" so you have a bit of blank space that no color will attach to because the wax took over.  Also, the paler colors (light yellow, yellow, tan, peach) had weird dark marks in them, which I finally realized was actually IN the lead, as my yellow had a blob of blue in it. After I realized it, I was able to sharpen the pencil and get the blue out of it, but not before my drawing was pretty much ruined. (It was as if when they mixed the batter, they didn't dissolve all the parts, like if you get a chunk of flour in your brownie...) Also, there are many, many shades of green, and very few shades of red.  Also, there are 2 white and 2 black pencils, so you don't even get 50 colors, just 48.  And who really needs a white pencil?

These are beautiful, well-made notebooks that any journaler would enjoy using.\n\nPros:\n-thick quality paper, no worries about bleeding through here like some cheaper journals\n-nice size - bigger than the pocket Moleskines I usually use, but a great size to slip into a purse or bookbag, with lots of room on the page without being too bulky\n-lovely hardcover made with soft leather in a beautiful blue shade - I hope they release more color options soon!\n-320 pages=LOTS of words.  Appreciate the length\n\nCons:\n-the first lined page is stuck to the end-paper at the binding, so it can't be opened all the way because of the way it's glued together\n-the binding isn't quite as high quality as I'd have liked, I don't think this will be quite as durable as my Moleskines\n-this is just a personal preference, but I wish the stamp for the brand was on the back of the journal, not the front.  I like my front cover to be nice and blank, not branded\n\nAll in all, I'm very pleased with this journal, despite the minor cons listed above.  If you're interested in trying a new brand, this is a great option to check out!\n\nI received a discount on this product in exchange for testing, inspecting and reviewing it.

Firstly PRO's, it is exactly as picture describes and is super easy to put together. The pages are durable, and comparable to past reference organizers. It sits nicely and I have it pushed back right up against the wall, kinda suspended above my phone.\n\nThere were comments about the pins being plastic, they are, they are a thick plastic, But, you would have to really get rough with it to break them... don't see them as a problem. Maybe take a deep breath and use some patience sticking the pages in? Really not that hard. They pop right in.\n\nThere are also comments about this \"sticking out alot\". Idk, I have it right above my phone on the narrowest side of my desk, against a wall, and it's pretty flush with the wall, when I have it open it is still pretty flat against the wall, a little sticks out, but not excessively. I can easily access my phone with it there.\n\nCON: It's really not a hydraulic smooth thing you can pull and push around. Those black knobs you see in the picture are to tighten and loosen the movable aspect. So, you can tighten it so you can move it down to you, and up, but after 1-2 movements those knobs will need to be tightened again. I guess I was thinking it was more like a hydraulic arm or something that held its own. I did put in some pages both portrait and landscape, you can use it easily either way. BUT to change from one way to another is a pain, like I said, you have to keep adjusting those knobs. So I just minimized the pages and have everything in portrait view. But you can fully use this for landscape pages as well.\n\nAnother thing that's weird is the thing that clamps to the desk, and the arm are just connected via, the arm sits over the clamp area. So it swivels super easy, but there is nothing there to hold the arm on, so if you lift it up it kinda wants to come off. It's about 6 inches so unless you are super aggressive (refer back to my patience comment above) it will not come off, but it is just something to get used to. :)\n\nI like it.

I spent an afternoon awhile back getting a lot of our paperwork together in one place  it now fills one drawer in a file cabinet in my home office.  So when I saw this Smead LIFE DOCUMENTS ORGANIZER KIT I thought it sounded interesting  it keeps all of your most important documents in one portable box which can then be stored wherever you like.  Now that Ive had a chance to play around with it a little, Im not sure theres anything in this kit you cant put together on your own for a lot less money.  In fact, you can set up your own filing system that reflects your own life, rather than Smeads version of it.\n\nIncluded in the kit are the following:\n~1 black plastic file box, with a carrying handle\n~24 manila file folders\n~6 multi-colored hanging file folders\n~Pre-printed labels\n~1 sheet of plastic hanging file labels (for use with the pre-printed category headings)\n\nThe instructions suggest you divide your stuff into six categories  Personal, Ownership, Health, Communication & Wishes, Financials, and Contact Information.  Each category is color-coded to one of the colored hanging file folders, and there are pre-printed file tab labels (also color-coded) to organize your stuff within each category.  Some of these make sense  Health Records should be filed under Health, and Bank Records should be filed under Financials.  But others do not.  For example, the Pets file (which should hold your pets health and license records) is color-coded to be filed under Contact Information, and Safe Deposit Box (in which you store info on your key and location of your safe deposit box) is color-coded to be filed under Communication & Wishes (Ownership might make more sense).  Also, theres a label for Current Bills, which seems odd  its unlikely youll want to keep your current bills in a storage box like this.\n\nHeres the basic problem:  Theres either a lot more here than youll need, or a lot less.  If you have very complicated records, they undoubtedly won't fit in these small folders or this small box.  If you have very simple records, you won't need all these categories and folders.  And its unlikely the pre-printed labels will exactly fit your records.  Yes, you can always print your own, but youll have to buy printable labels, which is an added expense.\n\nAdditionally, this isn't a particularly sturdy box.  I have a hanging file box which is approximately the same size, and its much more solid with a much more secure clasp.  This Smead box is designed to look like its metal, but its not.  And the clasp seems quite flimsy  I doubt it will stand up to much opening and closing.\n\nFinally, I have to ask myself whether I want all of these documents stored in the same place  especially a place that is so easily portable.  The suggestion is that youll keep your will, your bank records, your safe-deposit information, and your account passwords in the same box.  Not smart.  That file cabinet I mentioned at the start of this review contains many important documents (titles to our cars, birth certificates, copies of our wills, the deed to our house, our marriage license, etc.).  It does not contain our bank records, investment records, and internet passwords  these things are kept separately.\n\nBottom line, its a good idea to get organized.  But for less money you could buy a whole lot more file folders and a better-quality box, and then decide for yourself what documents you want to keep in it and how youd like them organized.  I don't really see the value of this kit, beyond inspiring you to set up your own system.", "summary": "Yes, it's a good idea to get organized . . . but this kit isn't the answer", "unixReviewTime": 1461369600}

Up front, you should know that in order to for an inkjet to be useful, it needs to be used regularly--say at least one or a couple times a month; otherwise, the ink clogs up the heads and, not only affects print quality, but will waste TONS of ink from the cartridges as you run a cleaning to unclog. You will spend a lot on consumables (ink), so if you're a sporadic at-home printer like my family, make a switch to laser printers. Yes, inkjets can be cheap (when I bought this model, it was only $60, a popular price point for many models, but you spend much more on frequent printing (sometimes higher than having them professionally printing).\n\nWith that out of the way, here is my review of this particular printer. I bought it with the intention of using it for borderless printing for my son's invitations, but you can't really do that for special paper sizes. Works fine for flyers on 8.5x11, but I use special paper sizes for invitations, and even with trying to configure it manually, it would not accept them, and I had to use a machine at work. Print quality was decent, but it expended huge amounts of ink, thus ballooning the price per print to huge levels. It prints about the same speed as other inkjets I've had, so neither fast or terribly slowly, but there is a long startup between spooling the print and actually printing--annoying when you're heading out the door and need a confirmation or something printed.\n\nThe scanning works fine and scan quality is decent.\n\nWireless printing is sporadic. When the power would go out, I would have to reset everything, which is annoying.\n\nThe user screen is easy to use and attractive.\n\nThe machine is lightweight and average size, taking up the entirety of our little side table.\n\nThe reason I gave this machine two stars is simple--after a month and a half of use, a printhead clogged and would not unclog no matter how many times I cleaned it. In total, I maybe got six months out of this machine, frustrating the heck out my husband who is the one who used it more than anyone (which wasn't much).\n\nBottom line: I made the switch to a monochrome laser and will reserve color printing for the professionals (because I don't print often). Laser may not be great for printing pictures, but I wasn't really printing those at home anyway, and because it uses toner, it never dries out. It prints much faster, and it's also wireless and scans.
