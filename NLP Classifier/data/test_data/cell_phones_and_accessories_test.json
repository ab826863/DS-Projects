Did my research and ended up going with the Halo screen protectors. I've never used (nor heard of) the brand before, but I have applied decals and racing stripes to numerous cars in the past, so I wasn't particularly fond of a dry application that this protector used.  However, none of the wet-application protectors offered seemed very enticing this time around, and for $7, I could get THREE!  Figured I would just dive right in.\n\nI'll come right out and say that I am a perfectionist, and ANY little particle underneath the protector just wasn't acceptable to me.  That said, I ended up having to use all 3 of the protectors before I was able to get a 99% flawless application.  If I had a 4th, I would have tried it once more but I was happy with the final product.  There is a video posted on their website that shows the recommended method of application, and I would highly advise checking it out before you dive in.  Unlike wet application covers, you do NOT have the luxury of making full contact with the screen and then squeegeeing out any bubbles and/or imperfections.  While there is some form of very light adhesive on the side contacting the screen, it is mostly held in place by static cling.  My first 2 attempts found a number of micro particles that attached themselves to the adhesive, meaning that they were almost immediately tossed.  Lining up the holes took a great deal of concentration, and if not for a misalignment, the 2nd attempt would have initially worked.\n\nA minor note on installation for those who've never done this before...do it in your bathroom! Close the door, steam up the entire room to an almost uncomfortable level, and do not open the door or turn on a fan. This creates a nearly dust-free environment, as dust will be attracted to the steam, and very little will be left in the air. Wait until the steam settles and move on.\n\nThe surface of the protector that is touched feels smoother to slide your fingers on than the screen itself.  Previously, I used a Skinomi Techskin on my Galaxy Nexus, and found the protector to be way too soft...almost to the point that if you ran your fingernail across it, it would make an indentation that would last days.  This protector has a much harder, more ridged feel to it, which is much more appealing.  It doesn't feel rubbery and is as close to 100% transparent as I've ever seen.\n\nAnyhow, quick pros and cons summary for prospect buyers out there:\n\nPros:\nCost (3 for less than others charge for 1)\nNearly invisible\nVery hard and ridged protector\nFingers slide around on screen easily\n\nCons:\nSomewhat frustrating, time consuming dry application\nInstallation may use more than 1 protector to get it right\nDoesn't cover 100% of screen (gaps on all sides)\n\nI can honestly say that I have no real problems with this protector. Yes, it may be a major pain to get it installed perfectly flawless, but with 3 chances for $7, what have you got to lose?  I would buy it again, and just may if I feel that 99% isn't quite good enough for me.  Wouldn't be bad to have some backups on hand either if needed.  Very highly recommended!  I'll update my review if I notice any problems that arise.", "summary": "For $7, it's tough to find a better protector(s)!", "unixReviewTime": 1340755200}

The product advertising did not exaggerate the capacity and did not mention about being a fast charger. I'm also aware of this and hoping that I won't be too disappointed when I started using it. I find this wall charger not quite as fast charging of my phone compared to others. Then again it is still a solid wall charger and the speed to charge is decent at the rate specified with not blemishing of claim. The color is great and USB fit is perfect. Plug prongs are of good quality and plugs right in with no issues. The reason of taking 1 star off is because the amount of time to charge my phone is a bit slower than my other wall chargers (Fast Charge). I should be more generous since \"OnePlus\" did not exaggerate on how slow or fast this charger can charge. Then again, I should be fair of my assessments. OVERALL: it is a decent wall charger, having smooth surface and nice color appeal.\nDisclaimer: I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

It was great for the price.  Two years after using it I started looking for an upgrade because it was only HSPA+, the battery wasn't lasting as long, and 1GB of RAM was causing some issues.\n\nI looked at several phones including this one (and the G and G Play), the Huawei Honor 5X, LG and Samsung (used flagships and new budget phones), and a used Moto X.  It ultimately came down to the G series and the Huawei.  The Huawei doesn't support T-Mobile fully, so I decided to get the G series.  Around the end of 2016 the price came down to $230 on the G4 Plus and I pulled the trigger.\n\nWhat I like:\n-Battery is really good!  Lasts most of the day.\n-4GB of RAM means no issues with programs closing in the background.\n-The processor is pretty smooth for a budget phone.\n-The phone is pretty much a stock Google Android experience.\n-Tons of on-board storage and a SD Card slot\n\nWhat I don't like:\n-I am actually on my second one.  I had to return the first one as I was having issues with Bluetooth disconnecting from my Pebble Classic.  The second one works flawlessly.  I returned it to Amazon so I don't know how Lenovo/Motorola customer service is.\n-There is no magnetometer/compass.  My previous one had it.  It is bad if you are walking around doing things like geocaching, but doesn't affect things like car navigation too much.\n-There is backlight bleed toward the bottom of the screen.  It was on both of the devices I used but is not super noticeable.\n-Plastic on the camera lens (see other).\n\nOther stuff:\n-It has a fingerprint reader.  Not as cool as I thought it would be.  It turns on the screen if you touch it with any bit of skin which is kind of annoying.\n-Supposedly Nougat is coming.  It was supposed to come Q4 2016, but now it looks like Q1 2017.  I don't really care if it does.  I plan on rooting when the warranty runs out anyway.\n-The battery is not removable, but neither was the last one.\n-It has a camera.  It isn't the greatest.  It is about what you should expect on a pricier budget phone.  They used plastic on the lens instead of glass on the last one, so I have to be careful not to scratch it.\n-There is no NFC or wireless charging, but the last one didn't have that either.\n-It has Qualcomm Quick Charge.  It overvolts the USB port to charge the battery faster.  That doesn't sound healthy for long-term battery life, so I just use a regular charger as opposed to the bundled one.  It charges quick enough this way.\n-The call quality isn't \"HD\" or whatever buzzword they are using for the higher frequency range of call audio.\n-My old phone had stereo speakers, this only has one.\n-It has a headphone jack, but sounds slightly dead compared to my old G.\n\nOverall, I hope the next versions have better quality control and adds back in the magnetometer or I will look at different brands.  If Motorola/Lenovo wants to wow me, put in NFC, a removable battery, and \"HD\" voice.", "summary": "Decent.  It has been cost reduced compared to earlier versions.

Since the unit has a USB port, I can power up or charge-up any USB device I own.  I like to take my GPS on long trips so I now leave my car and wall charger at home.  I think the quality of this battery pack is very good and the price is very reasonable.  It is the best, longest lasting, and most versatile battery pack on the market. The customer service is excellent; they quickly answered all of the questions I had about the unit before I made the purchase.  I was so satisfied with everything about this product and the company; I purchased a second IMP500 to give as a gift for a friend.  She would give it the same review I did.

Mine has hardly gotten discolored and I've had it about 2 years I believe.\n\nThe \"Spigen Liquid Crystal...\" model for absolutely any phone is just the way to go, hands down. Tried it on 4 different types of phones so far now and compared it to other kinds of minimalist cases and even compared it to the Otterbox Commuter cases.\n\nOverall, long story short:\nThis case beats the pants off of every other phone case, and for a fraction of the price. Go hold an Otterbox Commuter case (not talking about Defender case, that one is for a different target audience) and you get a clunky brick in your pocket and get charged around $30 to totally ruin the look and design of the phone. Then, hold a phone in this case and you get a great design that you can barely see, while giving you a solid grip on the whole phone and stopping any damage from a lot of surprisingly harsh drops (can speak from experience). Even if it falls on its face, the lips is just enough to protect your screen. This case is more like a compliment to the curves of the original design (instead of feeling like you just took a beautiful flower and threw a big brown paper bag over it to keep it safe. Just kills the whole purpose of you liking the phone's aesthetics)\n\nFinal words:\nIt's crazy how well these work to protect the phone while being so minimal, and it looks premium at the same time. At a price point around $10, that is a hard mix of benefits to find without having some tacky looking design that ruins the look of your phone. Most places out there want to charge you $20-50 for a case that is functionally the same exact thing, and yet this design is just as good as any at keeping the sleek and premium look of the phone and showing off your phone's metallic backside.\n\nPro Tip:\nYou can also decide to put a picture, or even just press a leaf or something back behind the case to switch things up with your phone case. Give the case even more utility and doesn't cost you anything extra to customize it to your liking.", "summary": "The best phone case for any phone model, period.", "unixReviewTime": 1498435200}

I can assure anyone who buys this it is the best protection you are going to find for the OPO. And pretty much the only \"otter box\" style case for it too. I love how the volume buttons and power all are heavy duty and raised on this case.. because they feel squishy and kinda cheap on the phone itself.\n\nI like the case, and it fit great with my tempered glass.

However, my review will be honest and unbiased. Over the years, I've tried a lot of different screen protectors. All of them ended up in the trash. I wasn't fan of protectors until this one, which will go a long way changing my mind. I always had problems aligning them with the phone. Once I got them on, more problems would arise, mainly they interfered with apps functionality. The apps wouldn't work properly until I removed the protector. I really like the iPhone 6 Plus Screen Protector by Maxboost because it was easy to install, and they provided really good instructions, cleaning wipes- -microfiber wet and dry- - and stickers, for alignment and dust removal- - to help you align the protector onto the phone screen. If you're still struggling, they include a QR Code link to an installation video, which I don't think you will need because the instructions are pretty easy to follow.  For those of you who have issues installing protectors- -as do I- -will find these items useful, and will take some of the frustration out of placing it on your phone. It is still a little bit tricky, but not all that hard. It doesn't quite fit over the phone, and it does leave the edges uncovered. This was not a problem for me because I use a phone case that protects the edges. I have used several apps, and they work fine, so no problems there. I really liked the packaging, the item came in a padded envelope. The case in in a really nice sturdy case to protect the protector- -no pun intended- -and the case was inside of a bubble wrap bag!

The first reaction is that it is yet another smartphone, without being the cutting edge business device that BlackBerry used to be.  This is perhaps not giving the Leap its due, particularly since one of the selling points is the security provided by the device.  I cannot speak to the technical aspects of this security, so I will just take it on faith that this is a secure device, particularly considering the low cost.\n\nAs a recent smartphone adopter, I struggled with the iPhone vs. android decision, and ended up with the iPhone.  This review is from the perspective of an iPhone user.  All told, the BlackBerry Leap doesn't make me regret the iPhone choice.\n\nTactile: The Leap feels pretty good, about the same weight as my iPhone 6.  The screen is clear and bright, although images don't seem quite as sharp.  I wish the corners were rounded a bit more, as this didn't feel very ergonomic.\n\nCameras:  The main (away) camera is very solid.  It takes good, crisp pictures.  The front facing camera is simply OK, but will provide a slightly grainier image for selfies, etc.  The iPhone camera has a greater variety of functions.\n\nData Storage:  Equipped with a minimal 16 GB storage, the Leap makes expanded memory mandatory.  Fortunately, with MicroSD, you can supplement it.  My iPhone has more storage, but is not expandable, and the Leap can potentially expand to provide more storage than my iPhone.\n\nBattery Life:  Substantially longer for the Leap.  A better, more efficient battery.\n\nPhone functions:  It does them just fine.  You won't be disappointed or delighted in this aspect.\n\nApps:  Comes loaded with Amazon Apps, and has a good selection of apps for use.  The pre-loaded apps are acceptable, but not great, particularly when contrasted with those on an iPhone.  Both come with map and alarm clock functions, but the Leap versions just aren't as advanced.\n\nAll told, there is nothing particularly wrong with the BlackBerry Leap.  It will work just fine, and has a superior battery.  The price is very good.  But use just feels lacking, and the overall impression is that BlackBerry is playing catchup with the other smartphones, and still has a good ways to go.", "summary": "As an entry level, it's not bad, but not great", "unixReviewTime": 1433548800}

The Z3 is a great phone but is plagued by some QC issues and terrible customer support. Rather than deal with Sony, I elected to buy through Amazon. Unfortunately, the first model did not pass the waterproof pressure test, and the second's back cracked overnight for no apparent reason (a documented fault).\n\nI made the conscious decision to buy this one used not just to save money, but also because I thought that if this phone was previously used and is still in excellent condition, then its possible that it has avoided the problems that a lot of other customers reported in the first few days of using this phone. This has seemed to hold true as I have had zero issues with my unit so far.\n\nThe phone is theoretically very well-constructed with perfectly bonded metal, glass, and vinyl corners (to absorb drops). For such a seemingly fragile device, it performed surprisingly well in a drop test I found on the internet where the guy had to stand on a bench with the phone above his head to cause damage to the phone. Of course, that may have been an exceptional unit, but it was a fairly reassuring example. I actually use a wrist strap for piece of mind, and I have grown to love this advantage; I can feel safe while also using no protection or case at all on my phone, something I will probably never do with any other handset. I did have to cut a paper clip into a hook in order to help push the wrist strap through the provided hole, but it was worth the effort and I did not damage the phone.\n\nRegion/Software Info:\n\nMy particular unit was an unlocked device originally from the carrier TIM in Italy. The phone was reset 4.4.4 KitKat and I had no problem selecting English from the first screen in setup. To my dismay, the phone is loaded with a few megabytes' worth of TIM apps that I quickly disabled in App Info as soon as I saw them; some can even be uninstalled. In order to enable mobile Internet Data, I had to first connect to wifi and use the \"Download Internet/MMS settings\" option to get the right Access Point Names for T-Mobile in the US. After installing Nova Launcher, I have a very clean Android experience, even after coming from a Nexus 4 as my last phone. Upgrading to Lollipop through Sony Update center worked fairly well; the only problem is that with so much bloatware, the \"optimizing apps\" stage of software updates took quite a while. I recommend factory resetting after completing the software updates to avoid some of the battery life/speaker issues that some Z3 owners reported after upgrading to 5.0.2.\n\nMy phone is delightfully waterproof, but I tested this first by typing in *#*#SERVICE#*#* into the phone dialpad and selecting the pressure sensor. With all flaps closed, a waterproof phone's internal pressure will rise when lightly pinched between the fingers; this was the test that my first unit failed. If the speakers of this phone get wet, they will sound very quiet and slightly raspy until they are properly dried out again; I don't think this is a Sony problem as much as it is a consequence of the speaker covers being, well, wet. There is a touch-block \"Small App\" available in the Android multitasking menu that can disable unwanted touches from water contacting the screen.\n\nUnhindered, the stereo speakers are very loud and vibrate the phone with every beat when maxed out. The screen is extremely bright, but the white balance is notoriously on the cold side, with whites nearly 10,000 K (normal whites are around 6500 K). White balance is easily adjusted in the Display menu, but doing so will drop the brightness very slightly. Its still no issue to see in daylight, however.\n\nSpeaking of colors, the camera suffers notoriously from the same blue-tint in almost all shooting modes. I find myself using Manual Mode and adjusting the white balance for nearly every photo because the default settings are simply way too far off the warmth of real life. Other than that, there is plenty of detail in the back camera and it is overall excellent provided that you have the patience to adjust a few settings. I was looking for a great camera when I bought this phone; it is overshadowed by the LG G4 and Galaxy S6 by about 10%, but I would say that waterproofing is obviously unparalleled by any other phone with an equal or better camera. The front camera, however, is grainy and pastes faces. It is only 2.2 megapixels; this should be vastly improved in the Z3+ model that will be released later this year.\n\nCall quality is excellent provided that a good signal is available. I use my phone on T-mobile so I have never really experienced great coverage but this phone has rarely let me down. However, I work in a large building with spotty reception; if I leave the cellular radio on, the phone will drain battery fairly rapidly as it stays awake trying to find a signal. Putting my phone on Airplane mode and reenabling Wifi and Bluetooth give me back the great battery life that this phone is renowned for. I often put my phone down at the end of a 16-hour day with around 45 to 50% battery remaining; leaving it unplugged will drain about 5% overnight. This phone can easily stretch to two-days' use, especially if it is turned off when you are asleep.\n\nSony makes great devices with plenty of potential and I'm glad I gave them a shot this time. It's a shame that they do not market their phones here as I'm sure they would be a hit if more people knew names other than Samsung and Apple. To me, this phone is the only one that fits my purposes in having a great camera, great battery life, great camera, and WATERPROOFING. If something does indeed go wrong, I will probably get an S6 next, but I will sorely miss the waterproofing, stereo speakers, battery life, wrist strap... actually, I might even give the Z3 one last chance!", "summary": "Could buying used actually be better than new in the case of the Z3?", "unixReviewTime": 1433635200}

It features excellent build quality and a great no contract price.  I happen to have a contract with AT&T and I simply put my sim card in this phone and I was up and running.  It doesn't do LTE speeds, but the faux 4G is good enough.\n\nWindows Phone gets a bad rap for lack of apps, and in some cases it is true.  There is no Google support, so if you use Google Voice, you have to do it in the browser.  Gmail can be checked with the built-in email client.  Other than the lack of Google support, most of the big name apps I use are there.  I'm missing Nest, but I can also do that in the browser.\n\nIf you want to, you can pin webpages, such as Google Voice or Nest to the Start screen and they essentially act as apps (albeit in the browser).\n\nThis phone is fast enough.  It isn't lacking in speed, as Windows Phone is seemingly optimized for Microsoft's minimum requirements.  You'll see it repeated in tech blogs and videos, and it is true.  Windows Phone feels the same no matter if you are on a 1Ghz dual-core processor (like this phone) or the more expensive models, which are 1.5 Ghz dual-core.  The new 1520 is a quad-core 2.2Ghz.  It will be interesting to see if a quad-core 2.2 Ghz processor makes a difference.\n\nOverall, I am pleasantly surprised by the entire package here.  It has enough speed, a very nice screen, and (mostly) all of the apps I use for an incredible price.  It also feels very comfortable in-hand.  If you are curious about Windows Phone, this is the perfect phone.  If you are on a budget, this is the perfect phone.  If you need a backup phone, this is the perfect phone.  No wonder this phone owns about 30% of the Windows Phone market (at the time of this writing).", "summary": "Wow", "unixReviewTime": 1385596800}

The fish eye is my favorite, macro next, and then the wide angle. Just to give you a heads up, the wide angle has left handed threads, the macro lens has right handed threads. These two lenses are screwed together to make up the wide angle lens so when you screw on the combo, as the macro tightens, the wide angle portion starts to loosen. Personally I think this is pretty clever. With this combo, you now have a bigger lens that's easier to handle to screw on to the case.\n\nIt's amazing how close I can get to the subject with the fish eye and still capture the full image.

The kickstand on the back when folded is too big and it rocks around and can easily slide on any surface. Also the screen protector is just cheap plastic. Also when put on I'm not sure what causes this but like an oily residue or something shows up on the screen when you use it. This slowly goes away when you stop touching it and it sits but when using it its visible (although slightly) and effects videos and such. I decided to just take this off and hope I don't get it wet as the screen protector combined with the rubber seals with the top plastic piece to prevent dust and water.\nDespite this i am overly satisfied with this product and am at peace knowing it will protect my S4 from any type of drop.", "summary": "Tough", "unixReviewTime": 1377648000}

It combines a charging base for your iPhone4S/iPod 4th generation (or below) and also has a handy AC extension outlet and a USB charge port to boot.  In this world of expanding technology, a device like this is ideal for me: I can charge my work iPhone4, charge my personal flip phone, and plug in an extension set for my home telephone all on my night table and using only a single device.  This sure beats having three cords dangling by my bedside and the need for jury rigging the dual outlet so I can plug in three devices.  In concept it's good.  Sadly, the iPhone does not sit securely in the dock and therefore doesn't always charge reliably.\n\nThe device is simply packaged with an insert that is supposed to ensure a good fit for an iPod or older iPhone.  The device is larger than you might think.  It's base is about 5 3/4 inches wide and 3 1/4 inches wide in the middle.  It tapers to about 4 inches in width as it rises up to 2 inches high.  This isn't a small and wimpy device.  It will take up a little desk or night table real estate. The unit also has a little heft to it, something that I think makes a lot of sense: it is sure on its four rubber feet and will not easily tip over or slip. On the back you have an AC extension outlet with a ground and a single USB port for charging.  If the RCA guys really wanted to impress, they might have put two USB ports on the back--there is surely enough room--but this is a minor issue.\n\nThe iPhone or iPod is simply inserted in a well on the top of the dock.  Another minor issue: the home button is obscured by the upper lip of the dock.  Granted, this is not a dock/speaker type of device, but if the well were simply shallower, the button would be accessible.\n\nThe major problem with this device is that the iPhone dose not 'click' securely into place, as it does when you connect its usual 30 pin connector.  I tried this with the iPhone in the minimalist, Incipio rubber case that I use and with the iPhone out of the case.  I tried using the insert and adjusting the backrest on the insert, still no luck. If I press the iPhone in place (with or without the rubber case) I get that satisfying beep and the screen flashes on.  Still, if I wobble the iPhone just a bit, the battery icon fluctuates between charging and not charging. You have to jimmy the iPhone a bit and make sure that the battery icon shows the lightning bolt to ensure that the thing is charging.  The first night I used this, I placed the phone in the dock and went to sleep.  In the morning, I realized the iPhone had slipped and didn't charge overnight.  I have tried the dock with and without the supplied insert and with and without the case on--it doesn't seem to make a difference.  The phone will definitely charge in this dock; however, the phone is still able to slip out of place easily if I bang the night table.  It would be nice if the device had an LED on the front to indicate whether the iPhone was charging or not.\n\nMost nights, I have been using the dock, but if I want to ensure a charge or will have the phone plugged in longer than one night, I simply use a 30 pin cord and plug the iPhone into the USB charge port on the back.  This works just fine, but it negates the need for having this kind of dock.\n\nOnce again, this is a great concept, but the implementation is less than stellar.  The device works after a fashion, but because the iPhone can slip out if you are not extra careful, I am giving this only three stars.", "summary": "Nice idea, not always so reliable", "unixReviewTime": 1354752000}

The Mountek nGroove provides an alternate method of using your CD slot, which arguably is going the way of the cassette deck with MP3s, music apps, and satellite radio taking over. The mount basically slides slightly into your CD slot and the screwing/tightening mechanism allows you to tighten the fit so the mount doesn't fall out. I thought this was an excellently thought out concept.\n\nNow to the negatives, which there are 2. First and most importantly, there are some car sound systems that this WILL NOT work well with. For example, my Accord's sound system has a the power/volume knob in the center, right below the the mount. As a result, the screwing/tightening mechanism basically pushes/covers the power/volume knob of the system. It my car, it actually pushes on the knob and makes the system unusable. So my suggestion is to look right below the center of your CD slot and see if the screwing mechanism will cause some issue with your system. My wife has her knob to the left side of the CD slot, so it worked perfectly for her.\n\nSecondly, the eject mechanism is just really difficult to manage. My vent mount has two buttons on each side of the lower part that you simply just pinch/press. That is very easy and user-friendly. This mount, on the other hand, has one button on the top of it that you have to press to release the side grips. I find the button to be quite annoying to manage, because you MUST use two hands to get the phone released. Two hands??? This is silly to me, given how easy it was to release my phone from the vent mount that I used with one hand.", "summary": "Unique design but beware of compatibility...", "unixReviewTime": 1356912000}

You will not be surprised by an empty backup battery with this one.\n\nThis backup battery has a stylish pink & white design, seems well constructed (states that it contains a Samsung 'Grade A' cell), and is of a very convenient and portable size. It is an easy carry in your purse, jacket pocket or back-pack. With its stated 1.0 amp output, this battery charged our phones at a rate typical of the performance we get from wall outlet charger... but only when using our phone's USB power cable to charge the phone.\n\nThe battery comes with a micro USB cable and adapters for Apple lightning cable and other notebook fittings. However, the performance we attained when using the supplied cable was not good... at best it charged our HTC Droid DNA at about 1/2% per minute or 30% in an hour. Additionally, we found the transfer drain to be large; roughly, boosting the DNA's charge up 30% used up about 45% of the LINKON battery's capacity. Since the DNA has a 2020mAh battery and this LINKON unit is advertized as 3000mAh, something seemed not quite right there. Additionally, the battery got very warm while charging the phone (warm, but not overly hot).\n\nHowever, we solved the issue fairly easily by switching to using the DNA's USB power cable. Both the charge rate and efficiency improved significantly to a level in line with expectations.\n\nThis battery is nice looking and conveniently sized, and the digital readout makes it simple and fun to use. LINKON's warranty coverage seems very strong, stated as \"14 day money back guarantee no questions asked if you are not happy with our product plus 12 month warranty for total peace of mind\", so if an issue arises before that period expires I will return here to update the review We did receive this unit gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.\n\nPortable, stylish and, when using your own power cable, did the job to meet our expectations. If you are looking for a battery pack of this size, great style and capacity, for use as I have described above, then I would say give this unit a try.  If it does not meet your expectations, you have their good guarantee and warranty to rely on.\n\nGo for it.", "summary": "LINKON Portable Power Bank Backup Battery - 1.0A Output - Pink - Digital readout is great - Works best with phone's USB cable", "unixReviewTime": 1413676800}

Most battery cases protrude well below and above the standard case.  The iPhone plus is huge to begin with, to anything that adds to it's height will be noticeable.  This case adds very little to the height of your phone, same as a regular thick case would.  The battery is stored in the back of the case, so it does impact the thickness a tad.  Not much, and again, not much more than a standard case would.  The texture is smooth, which I'm not a fan off.  It makes it slick and difficult to hold.  My grippy case was better in this respect.\n\nOnce you slide it in, it's good to go.  There's one button on the back and some lights that will indicate how much charge is left.  I noticed that some lightning cables fit better than others.  Third party cables may be thicker and will not fit as well.  The pass through technology is wonky and doesn't has to be be fiddled with to get a good fit.  If you plug in the cable, your phone will charge first, and when it's topped off, then the case will charge.  When using the device to play music through the usb/lighting cable, it was very sensitive, and would give me an error if I moved it too much.  Also, I could not charge the phone in the case with my lightning cable plugged into the computers USB port.  I think the power draw was too small.  I could only consistently charge it by plugging into a wall outlet.  Still despite all this I really like the product and give it a solid 4 stars.", "summary": "Compact battery case for a decent price", "unixReviewTime": 1465084800}

This super gel pad is actually a tape made of acrylic foam with a surface of millions of microscopic craters. Individually, the little craters have minimal suction, but together the entire surface of craters has major suction. This ring holder/stand has a rectangle of this tape on the back. It is meant to be mounted on very flat surfaces.\n\nThe square is 1 3/8 x 1 9/16.  The inside ring diameter is hard to describe, as it is a bit oval, with about 1 one way, and 7/8 the other way.  The ring swivels 360 degrees and will stay in place at any angle.\n\nRight now I have this attached to my air card (wireless adapter) so I can hang it from one of several Command hooks that I have anchored in high positions around several windows so I can get the best reception.  With the help of a hook, you could hang anything, as long as it has a flat surface and weighs less than four pounds.  And of course, you can use it as a stand for a small device, or hang a device from your finger.  Lots of uses.\n\nDo I think my devices are vulnerable to falling off of this small suction plate? NO. Do I think the stand comes un-stuck too easily? NO. Do I use common sense when mounting this stand? YES. What I'm trying to get across to you is this: Its surface needs to be totally clean and the surface you are sticking it on needs to be very clean.  The little craters in the foam can fill up with dust and dirt. I run an alcohol wipe over the surface where I want to mount the stand to remove whatever particles and grime might be there, make sure it's dry, then I stick the stand in place. Would I eat a burger and fries, while I'm holding my phone, then immediately stick the phone to the tape? Duh....NO.\n\nIt is meant to hold tightly, but can be removed easily by using a real tough thumb nail or a stiff credit card to get under a corner of it.  Dont use a screw driver or anything metal, as it can scratch the surface of your device.  Then pull slowly and the little suction craters will release.  What if it does get dirty and stop sticking perfectly well? Easy to clean! I like to use a wet paper towel, then let it dry thoroughly.\n\nAll in all this is a nice looking little stand with a minimalist style to it. It works very well. And I trust the micro-suction tape to hold tight and am not afraid to hang my devices from it seven feet above the floor.\n\n**I received a free sample product from RingStand.", "summary": "I trust this \"super gel pad\" micro-suction tape", "unixReviewTime": 1425513600}

To me that really isn't a big negative because the case fits well and is protective so I do not plan to take it off and on very often. The reason for deducting a star is that the sound on/off switch does not work with this case.

While the bright matte colored aluminum is slick, there is a very textured area on the stylus where your fingers grip so your fingers don't slip. What makes this stylus different from others I've used is the tip that comes in contact with your device. It's made of a silver colored, slightly textured fabric material. I tested it out some by pushing and pulling on the tip to see if it would easily become dislodged from the stylus and it doesn't. It works well on my Kindle Fire, but requires pressing down a little firmer when I use it on my iPhone 4s. The colors that these styluses come in are so bright and the aluminum surface holds up well without scratching easily. Because the aluminum is a matte color, finger prints don't show up at all. It's a very nice quality and beautifully colored full sized stylus that will fit anywhere you can keep something the size of a pen.\n\nA sample was provided for an unbiased review.", "summary": "The size and shape of a pen, with a unique tip.

Fits the phone pretty well, overall (except for the side buttons - see Con #1)\n\nCons:\n1. Case is loose, where the side buttons are.  You have to press the case pretty hard to use the buttons.\n2. The clear back is getting pretty scratched up.  I've had it about a week now, - I think in a few months, it may not be clear in certain spots anymore...\n3. The case is a little thick for my taste.

It can rock, if you push down on the corners/sides.\n\nIn short - this case works for now.  Meanwhile, I am still looking for a different case, or even a nice bumper fot this phone.

Inside the box was only the wall charger in a form fitting plastic insert to protect it. This is a fairly small, high powered dual port wall charger.  It measures 2.5\" x 2\" x 1\". It has two USB ports and provides a total output of 3.1 Amps. It has an Apple designated port producing 2.1 Amps and a Universal port producing 1 Amp.  It also has an blue power indicator light between the two ports. The prongs fold into the body of the charger for storage and travel. It appears to have a very good build quality.\n\n Use and Performance - I plugged it into a wall outlet and did some testing to see how the wall charger handles simultaneous charging. I took my iPhone 5 that had 39% charge and my iPad 2 that had 66% charge and charged them simultaneously. I plugged the iPad into the 2A Apple port and the iPhone into the 1A Universal port.  After 10 minutes, the iPhone charge increased to 49% and the iPad increased to 69%.  After 20 minutes, the iPhone charge increased to 59% and the iPad increased to 73%.  After 30 minutes, the iPhone charge increased to 68% and the iPad increased to 76%.  The iPhone charged at about 1% per minute and the iPad charged at better than 3% per 10 minutes. Some great results while charging two Apple products simultaneously. It did give off some heat when charging, but not too much.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, this is a great travel wall charger at this price point ($13 at the time of this review).  It has a large output capacity that charges multiple devices very fast. On top of that it is small and compact with folding prongs for storage and travel.  If you are looking for an inexpensive dual port wall charger, the 9to5Cables Dual USB Travel Wall Charger is one to try.

I have always liked the Commuter cases, but when I upgraded to the iPhone 5 last October I didn't initially buy a case for the phone because I liked the slimness of the phone and felt that the phone itself seemed durable enough to withstand daily use. I tend to carry my phone in my pocket -- either the front pocket of my jeans or the jacket pocket in my suit -- and generally this has been fine. No, the world does not come crashing down if you carry an iPhone without a case. Actually, as a guy (not a lady with a purse), it can be quite enjoyable to carry and use a well-built metal device that is slim enough to fit in any pocket without creating a bulge. I have a leather pouch (Mujjo) that I sometimes put the phone into depending on what kind of clothes I'm wearing or if I'm near water, but generally I have been caseless since October and the phone has not been damaged in any way that I can tell (and I tend to notice these things).\n\nAfter a few near-misses last month where I almost dropped the phone (but didn't), I decided that it might be good to go back to using a case, and because I like Otterbox I immediately gravitated toward the Commuters. But the Commuter case is thick enough that it removes much of the reason I have been loving the iPhone 5 - its form factor. I also found that some of its selling points over other cases -- like port covers and \"hybrid\" construction -- don't actually matter to me. That was why I decided to try the Reflex case.\n\nThe Reflex case fits the phone very well but does not add much thickness to the phone at all. I have been able to carry the phone in my pocket as usual without noticing any significant difference. Like the Commuter case, it contains parts made of both rubber and hard plastic which are designed to absorb shocks and bumps. Because it is not a hybrid case with a full rubber interior, it will not absorb quite as much abuse as a Commuter case would, but it also is much thinner and lighter. It's also quite easy to get on and off and, as far as I can tell, does not damage the phone in the process. This is important to me because there are times when I don't want to use the case, or I want to use a different case, like a Mophie extended battery pack. The Reflex is very well designed around the edges and ports of the phone and does not affect use. It does have a slight \"lip\" around the screen which is useful for preventing screen damage in the event of a fall (great design from past experience), but this does not affect typing on the device.\n\nSome other reviewers have reported difficulty connecting the standard Lightning plugs and chargers to the bottom of the phone; I have not experienced this problem at all. I connect the phone every day in the car and every night at home and never have difficulty.\n\nSome other reviewers have also reported problems with the \"slider\" design of the case coming apart occasionally; I have not experienced this problem either, but time will tell.\n\nI also like the look of the case on my black iPhone 5. One of the reasons I wanted a case for my phone was to make it stand out from all the other corporate iPhones around me. Mission accomplished there.  Most of the color schemes sold on Amazon -- including the \"Radiate\" one that I picked -- are cool but rugged looking. I do wish that the semi-transparent back of the case did not have as much writing on it (patents, etc.) but that's a minor gripe. I also wish that the button covers for the lock and volume buttons were not so stiff, but this is also not a big problem.\n\nOverall I think this is a great case for someone looking for protection almost as good as the Commuter case while still retaining most of the thinness of the iPhone's naked design.", "summary": "Great Compromise Case", "unixReviewTime": 1362355200}

Using it out in the sun is no problem either because of the Super AMOLD display.

Comes with all the normal accessories from dust stickers, cleaning cloth, wipes, and 2 screen protectors. Packaging is fantastic. I worked in retail for a major phone provider putting screen protectors on, so this went on with ease with zero bubbles and no \"halo\" effect. I recommend having someone experienced put this on to avoid any issues. It does not cover edge to edge and for Moto X pure does not obstruct flash or camera in any way.

I could see myself cutting a hole in this area down the line, but I'm not sure if that would impact the overall fit of the case.

Since the Lumia has all of it's buttons (volume, power, camera) on the same side of the phone, I was worried about the arms of the mount pressing in on them.\n\nI wanted a mount that could also be used with a case and it seems that mounts that are made specifically for the lumia 920 have issues if you use a case.  This works great since the arms adjust width-wise.  I use a Speck case.\n\nIt is best to use this upside down for the Lumia 920.  While you can use it upside up, you will not have access (or very difficult access) to the power button.  But it works perfectly upside down with access to the power button, and the arms don't press in on any of the other buttons.\n\nThe mount itself fits great on the vents in my Mercury Sable (2002) and my Ford Explorer (2002).  The only issue with the Sable is that the 2 mounting clips need to go through these 2 wider openings that surround the finger adjustment on the vent.  But it fits perfectly there like it was made for it.  No issues at all in the Explorer.\n\nThe clamps adjust very easily to keep your phone in place.  Press a button and they pop out, releasing your phone instantly. Close them together to adjust to almost any sized phone.  Just need to squeeze a bit hard to get that last click in place to have a solid hold on the Lumia 920.\n\nThe tabs that swing out from the top or bottom that your phone rests on, could be a tad bit bigger.  They're there to help keep your phone in place while you clamp the mount to your phone.  Also the clamps are big, much bigger than they need to be.  I suppose if you're using an Otter box or some huge case, it's great.  The slight cushion inside the clamps allow you to press harder to get a nice secure fit to your phone.\n\nI'd give it a 5 star rating if it fit the Lumia perfectly upside-up and closed nicely without having to squeeze as hard as I do to get it to a nice snug fit where I know it's not going anywhere.  But overall, I'd get this mount again. I really like how it clips onto the vents so it's out of the way, not visible on my windshield or dash.  Great mount overall!", "summary": "Works with the Nokia Lumia 920", "unixReviewTime": 1363824000}

I decided to try a case at least for a while as the phone would cost a lot of money to replace if I dropped it.\n\nI needed a case for mine and my wife's so I bought 3 of these cases when they had the buy 2 get one free promotion. I got them in white, black and blue. I was pleasantly surprised with them when they came. They are very sharp looking, fit the phone great without adding too much bulk and feel really good in the hand.\n\nYou can't tell from the photos really but the part of the case with the Android on it and the sides where your hand would grip it are a matte finish and the rest of it is a gloss finish. The contrast is really attractive and the case has a nice overall grippy feel making it less likely you'll drop the phone. The sides also have textured lines on them to add to the gription (note: gription may not be a word but it should be).\n\nPros:\n-Fits perfect\n-Seems like a good balance between protecting the phone while keeping added bulk to a minimum\n-Grippy\n-Very attractive colors, blue in particular\n-Great price for a quality case\n\nCons:\n-I can't really think of any, maybe dust getting behind the clear plastic once in a while?", "summary": "Love this case", "unixReviewTime": 1336262400}

Nettle", "reviewText": "As soon as I purchased an iPhone, I knew I had to get something to protect it from my clumsiness, and after looking around at a friends Defender (and realizing how BIG of a case it was) I wanted something smaller, but still able to handle punishment.  So far, the Commuter has fit the bill.\n\nThe Commuter consists of 3 parts, a screen protector (applied with an applicator to 'try' to smooth out the bubbles), a silicon sleeve to protect the sides and back from drops and impacts, and frame / metal wrap to keep the silicon sleeve in place.\n\nOverall, the pieces and parts work well to protect the phone from scratches, dings, and most importantly (for me) drops.  I've dropped the phone several times now on hardwood floors (just my lack of coordination) pulling it out of my pocket (3ft) and have seen no signs of damage to the phone.  The screen protector is doing its job, and doesn't seem to easily scratch (the phone sometimes rides around in my pocket with keys, and still looks perfect).  Additionally, since most of the ports are well protected, small splashes haven't seemed to hurt it at all, even though it doesn't claim waterproof abilities.\n\nAnother nice thing about this case is that it adds very little in the way of size.  The iPhone is a fairly good sized phone to begin with, but this case is a very small addition and the protection is well worth it.  The buttons are all easy to press with the case on, and the speakers still provide close to the same sound (from what I can tell).\n\nThe only reason I've given this a 4 instead of a 5 is because sometimes the case tries to slip from the edges occasionally, and the covers for the ports can sometimes be a pain to get back into place.  Overall though, I can't complain and have been very happy with its level of protection and small size.", "summary": "Durable, and Hardly Noticable", "unixReviewTime": 1257379200}

The overall hardware is incomparable and really stands out in comparison to that of the competition. The 12 megapixel camera takes outstanding pictures and can easily replace a \"point and shoot\" camera.. Honestly the phone is an honest good buy but the Symbian OS ruines the whole user experience.\n\nI have been an avid Nokia user since the release of the Nokia N95. From there on I have owned the N82, N86 and jumped to the N900 last year. After being spoiled using the Maemo OS found in the N900 I honestly hoped that the Symbian's OS update would catch up and even exceed Maemo which has now evolved into MeeGo thanks to it's partnership with Intel. Sadly Symbian stays way behind and I found myself wanting to throw the phone across the room at times due to the various frustrations it caused.\n\nConstant freezing, long wait time, and constant clicking from one thing to another just to get a task done. I love you Nokia but Android and Apple's iOs have left you behind. I'm only hoping that Nokia's next flagship phone has MeeGo OS as it's software platform and maybe I'll jump back and be the happy customer I once was when owning a Nokia device.\n\nOverall if your looking to own a phone with excellent call quality, outstanding hardware/build and looking to replace your \"point and shoot\" camera with a phone then go ahead and make your purchase. But if your out looking for a great overall Smartphone then I recommend you look away from anything running Symbian.", "summary": "Great Hardware/ Questionable OS", "unixReviewTime": 1291852800}

I commend BLU for offering a phone at this price point.  I really wanted to see a low cost option.  Initially my review was one star but I am now changing it to 3 stars.\n\nI ignored the one star reviews about phone rebooting itself constantly.  When I first got it, that's all it did with the AT&T SIM in the phone.  It couldn't charge because it rebooted constantly.\n\nAs for ATT, I tried two SIMS, ensured the right IMEI number was registered (remember this has two SIM capability so there are two IMEI numbers).  At the ATT store, we gave up as well.\n\nTo save you some hassle, here are some tips:\n\n1. Tech support requires an enormous amount of personal information which is not necessary to troubleshoot this problem.  I can understand email address, maybe a first and last name but why do you need my cell phone number when any contact info would suffice in case we get disconnected?  You are not marketing, stick to troubleshooting my problem\n4.  Troubleshooting is simply nothing more than doing a hard reset, instructions available on the web.  By the way, a hard reset through the settings did not work for me.  Technical support did offer an alternative method (below).  However, I have 3 other Windows phones and I knew tech support's instructions were wrong (key sequence).  I also did not receive their email for whatever reason.\n1st way to reset:\nGo to settings, about, scroll down to reset your phone (easier)\nOR\nUse the key sequences below:\n*Make sure your phone is off.\n*Press and hold Volume Down button then power button (together)\n*The moment it vibrates, Release the power button till an exclamation sign appears\nNow release the Volume Down button.\nNow enter the following sequence within a second or two of each other\n*Press Volume Up button.\n*Press Volume Down button.\n*Press Power button.\n*Press Volume Down button.\nPhone reboots\nIf you see spinning gears, you have done it correctly.  If not, you screwed something up, start the sequence again (or do it the easy way above :)).\n\nI was ready to ship this back after doing a hard reset (easy way twice and hard way once).  For some reason, I decided to uncheck 3g under cellular.  The moment I did that, it connected to AT&t and all was well.  Or it was just a coincidence, maybe I had to hard reset 3 times.  I checked 3G once again and all is well.  Maybe ATT issue not accepting a 3G connection or just a coincidence.\n\nThe phone also updated twice during the process by the way so I have the latest 8.1 release.  Note the hard reset doesn't revert back to previous OS versions so that's good news, it just cleans the data.\nBottom line, I shouldn't have to do all this but if your phone reboots and you still want to keep it, hope this review/troubleshooting helps.\n\nIf your phone works out of the box, you were luckier than I.\n\nNow the phone has been working for 8 hours with no problems.  I desperately need a storage card as my daughter already decided to load 1GB of apps on it so 116MB available, oops.  If the phone is dependable, I will up the stars to 4 or even 5 due to its value.\n\nAs for Windows OS, I like it but this review is for the phone only.\n\nUpdate:  6/22/15.  Phone is now rebooting on its own and inoperable for the most part.  I tried a hard reset but screen freezes, it reboots, it's a mess.  Still under warranty.  Note you must pay for shipping and it takes 10-15 days for BLU to assess and give you options.  Will update but that's a long time without a phone so it's a bummer that they don't cross ship.\n\nUpdate 7/9/15:  They sent me a refurbished phone, took about 2 weeks for the end to end exchange.  Seems to be working ok.", "summary": "it should be a great value. I commend BLU for offering a phone ...", "unixReviewTime": 1420675200}

Some have external cords, and others (like this charger) plug directly into an outlet. If you're looking for a USB charger, you've got a lot of choices. :) Only you know the best set of specs for your needs, so I'll just try to describe what I think are the relevant qualities of this model.\n\nThis is essentially identical to another charger that I recently reviewed (except that one is white) - which is great because both are quite nice.  First, it's very well made. Rock solid with no loose parts or rattles at all. The retractable plug snaps firmly into place in both the open and closed position, and it's not difficult to move. The USB ports are sized properly so that cables plug in with ease but are not wobbly or loose inside.\n\nThe whole unit has an Apple-ish look and feel to it. Well, old school Apple when they offered some glossy black plastic units, that is. :)  It just has that same quality feel that my Apple gear has.\n\nPersonally, I really like highly compact units like this because I think that they are great for travel. Assuming that wherever you are staying has a power outlet readily available, that is. Luckily, most hotels seems to have one or more power outlets exposed on top of a desk (such as the two on the base of a table lamp at the hotel that I stayed in last week). If you stay somewhere in which the outlets are further out of reach, you'd probably benefit from a different charger that comes with a power cord unless you get an extension cord for this.\n\nTwo outlets is perfect for me because I tend to take a phone and a tablet with me, and this can charge both with ease. Both ports can handle up to 2.4A, which is beyond what I need on any of my phones or tablets.\n\nI have nothing bad at all to say about this charger - I think that it's a great product. If it meets your needs for number of ports, current capability, and outlet accessibility, I recommend it.", "summary": "Fantastic little charger that is great for travel or home", "unixReviewTime": 1431561600}

I had the Jawbone II before that.  This is an all around good headset, but the multiple size ear fittings are what make it great for me.  I tried a lot of other bluetooth headsets before finding the jawbone, it was the first one that I could actually get to fit my ear.  It stays put without even having to use the ear loop.  Of course, fit is entirely subjective.  You have to try it on to see if it's going to work for you, just like a pair of shoes.\n\nIn other categories, the Jawbone does well.  Volume output is good, I never have an accidental hangup.  Mic pickup is excellent.  Connection with my phone is pretty consistent.  Really, no complaints on performance.\n\nMy one and only gripe is the longevity.  Like I said, this is my 4th Prime.  The 3 previous ones have all suddenly died after 6 to 12 months of use.  Granted, I use it a ton.  But it's not the battery wearing out, the charge stays consistent even after up to a year of use.  But then the time comes, like this morning, where something inside the Jawbone just dies and it won't come on anymore.  This was a bigger gripe back when you had to pay $90 for one, now that they are only ~$30 it's hard to complain too much.....\n\nI'll keep buying and using these because they work perfectly for me, though I get irritated with the sudden death, it's the best bluetooth I've found.  And an incredible deal at the price.  And since other bluetooths I've owned have useless battery life after a year anyway, it's not really any loss by comparison.\n\nUPDATE: Now on number 6.  Number 4 was lost never to be seen again.  Number 5 had was defective. Recommend staying away from the 'bulk' packaged Jawbone prime.  I've had two instances where the audio clarity is terrible when I've gotten one of the bulk Jawbones (just means no OEM box, the bluetooth comes packaged in bags but still includes all accessories).  Could be coincidence, but definitely make sure if you are ordering from a third party vendor and not Amazon directly that they have a good return policy.", "summary": "Good for the hard to fit ear", "unixReviewTime": 1300665600}

After watching multiple videos on these products, and having had a number of cup holder, vent based, and CD slot type phone holders I settled on this dashboard mount.  Installation was simple--pulling off the cover on the bottom adhesive pad, positioning it on the dashboard, push down and actuate the rear vacuum switch.  (There is also another pad in the package if you have some odd shaped surface).  After the first day, I decided to reposition it.  With some minor pulling, the entire unit came loose, leaving a clean dashboard and the same adhesive surface ready for repositioning.  Amazing?!\n\nSitting on the dashboard, both portrait and landscape viewing is possible with an easily articulated head.  The head moves in all directions (restricted only by the dashboard and the base itself).  The movement of the head is tight enough to hold position during driving and general use, but not so tight as to make it difficult to move when necessary.  Surprisingly, on an iPhone 6, I can position the bottom side edges of the phone in order to actually use the phone as a camera or take videos while driving--it is no mounted \"Go-Pro\" but it works for me.\n\nA couple of reviewers (notably ZacK Hill with videos) provided all the information I needed to make the right purchase, especially by showing the actual installation and then showing how stable a given installation might be.

It's got a nice grip and a sharp, solid feel\n* Protection: The edges raise above the screen and the corners are padded, so your phone's protected. I dropped my phone flat on its face and it was fine when I picked it up. This thing's payed for itself already\n* Look: The case has an iron-man-esque look to it, and the colors complement the iPhone's design\n* Slim: The case doesn't add much dimension to the phone, so it's not bulky\n* Vibration: The case doesn't interfere with the phone's vibration, so you can leave it on mute and still feel calls\n\nCONS:\n* Buttons: The buttons require a lot more force to press, and the mute switch is harder to access\n* Dust: The edges of cutouts for the bottom (headphone,mic,charge,speaker) will build up dust because the dust has no way out. Easily remedied by a once-a-week/month cleaning, depending on how much you care about it\n\nI would definitely recommend this case", "summary": "Payed for itself already", "unixReviewTime": 1473984000}

In the meantime I had been shopping around to no avail and even went to Wal-Mart and tried to find an Otter box for the Note 5, sorry they don't carry them, period.  But out of curiosity, I checked out the ones for the 8 just to see the quality.\n\nAnyway, my case arrived and it is perfect. I see NO difference in quality from the Otter box series at silly prices for what you get, especially at Wal-Mart no less, and as I said, they only carry cases for the 9, 8, and down to 7 on the S series so save the trip.\nIn fact, I think this design is better.\nI like it WAY better.\n\nFirst off... it's easy to grip because it has the cut out pattern on the sides of the inner shell. The phone control buttons are still snapy and work well. Everything lines up well plenty of room to plug in head phones, cord, and S Pen clicks out easily. The cut outs are large in other words. Case fits tight and snug on my Note 5. Reviews that say theirs does not fit got the wrong case my guess. I mean there is no way this can't fit snug.\n\nIt has a hard rubbery feel. Does not add much bulk to the very slippery glass backed phone. Even with inner and outer shells on.\nIt looks much bulkier in the picture. My last case on my Note 4 was all flat and rubbery. It did not really slide, even on a dashboard. This will. It is not that gell like sticky rubber.\n\nSo, I really like the outer shell option with the stand. This is the design you see with the pattern of raised little squares. Inside shell is flat and smooth. Outer has the same feel as inner shell, like a hard, yet plyable rubbery plastc. It was similar to the Otterbox feel.\n\nOuterbshell snaps on easily at the four corners and two trips in the middle to the inner shell.  Once on, that outer shell is not going anywhere, fits nice and snug.\n\nStand is nice, works well, easy to deploy and snaps securely into place.  It is on a When done, it easily closes and snaps securely flat. Like anything, if you are rough with the stand, impatient, it will break, no matter what brand.  If you are gentle, you will get some good use. Stand does have a metal hinge pin, and a metal snap in pin, similar to a bigger watch pin. It's not just plastic with a crease or those horrible magnetic deals that RUIN your phone...no. Stand fold down pretty close to flat with pattern. This should easily fit in your vehicle holders. Things are smooth feeling, corners nicesly rounded, should not snag in pockets.\n\nEven if the stand breaks in time, I would still buy another one because no where have I seen the kind of secure grip this offers. All your five fingers fit nicely right in the groves of the cut out pattern. Great when typing or taking pictures or videos. Hard to explain.\nThis would be great for people with small or even large hands, maybe a clumsy grip, surely for anyone that has dexterity problems.\n\nYou can wireless charge with the case on as well.\n\nGetting another to put away...incase they discontinue for sure.\n\nHope this helps....", "summary": "Very Good Case. Very good looking, NOT cheesy or cheap. N", "unixReviewTime": 1534032000}

And of course it wants to roll off a desk or table all the time.\n\nSo much to my joy, Anker has introduced their latest battery which addresses a need at the exact opposite end of their trend to make bigger and even bigger batteries. The E1. It's kind of like a squooshed Astro Mini ... about the same length (3.8\" vs 3.7\") and still only 0.9\" high. The width is a bit more at 1.7\" vs 0.9\" and the weight is 4.2oz vs 3.0oz. Yet, because of the very rounded case it actually feels about the same size and actually feels slightly lighter. It DEFINITELY fits more comfortably into the front pocket of my jeans.\n\nThe E1, at $24.99 packs a significantly bigger punch than the $19.99 Astro Mini - 5200mAh vs 3200mAh and that is the #1 most exciting improvement. Now instead of a quick boost to let me make a few more phone calls or send a few emails, the E1 can get me through the entire evening with enough reserve power to give my iPad Mini a boost.\n\nMore power isn't the only improvement though. The E1 has Anker's ubiquitous mini LED status lights so I know exactly how much power I have left. It also features Anker's PowerIQ amp-adjustment technology which intelligently identifies your device to deliver its fastest possible charge.\n\nThe design of the E1 complements the rest of the E1 series of external batteries (however with only one USB charging port and no flashlight). The only (and insignificant) difference is the exclusion of the mesh carrying bag which, frankly, I would never use for a battery of this size.\n\nAnker has scored another home run with the E1 and sorry to say I've reserved a place in my front pocket to replace my Astro Mini (which now lives in my car's storage compartment). It would be hard not to rate this as a true 5-star product.", "summary": "Perfect pocket size - packs a punch", "unixReviewTime": 1418860800}

The clear coating with black trimming looks really good with the white S6 so I wouldn't recommend it for the black sapphire.\n\nAlso, unlike most cases, the UAG does not interfere with the buttons so, while it may seem stiff at first, one can still operate the buttons with ease and not worry about any \"runoff\" and, by that, I mean having your fingers accidentally hit other buttons while touching the home button.  One of my biggest gripes on open-faced cases is that the case overlaps onto the screen too much so when you hit the home button you repeatedly hit another button cause you have to hover half your thumb over the case.\n\nAll in all, the UAG is an excellent case and the clear is perfect for the white S6.", "summary": "As Rugged As One Would Expect From UAG", "unixReviewTime": 1432598400}

The number 1 priority for me is to be visible, do everything one can do to make sure that others motorists see you and that you can also see well in the dark. I also like to listen to songs while i cycle and i hate to keep the phone in my pocket. Enter Bike phone mount kit.\n\nProduct Description (First Impression)\nIt comes in a nice packaging box, 4 items in the box, 1 bike mount which holds the phone, 2 secure flex bands, front bike light and its mount, rear tail light. In general everything is made of plastic with few rubber mounts to hold the phone and screws to tighten the clamps.  The flashlight has the capability of zooming the light X1 to X2000. The torch and the tail light have different patterns for example on 1 click they will switch on, on second click they will flicker and on 3rd will blink. No Manual, comes with 3 AAA batteries.\n\nPros:\n1: The head lights is probably the best part, excellent quality! the torch has a zooming functionality and you can literally focus the torch to a small square or zoom out to cover a larger area.\n2: The torch comes with 3 AAA batteries , so you don't have to buy some.\n3: The clamps that tighten the phone screw into a metal nut , this guarantee's that the clamps and the tightening can be efficiently re used.\n4: I like that the clamps has rubber padding inside the clamps this was my bicycle bar will not get scratched.\n5: The one clamp which holds the phone i really liked because now i don't have to keep my phone in my pocket , this way the phone stays safe and i can listen to songs over my wireless blue tooth headphones.\n\nCons:\n1:The plastic that is used to make all these parts i felt sometimes was not the best of the quality, like the cylinder that holds the bike lights doesn't feel sturdy and strong enough but its not to the point that its of any concern.\n2: Remember to tighten the screws which hold the phone before you put it on the bicycle or it is difficult the tighten it from under the bar.\n3: I tightened the clamp that holds the torch but when i was to press the button which switches on the torch it was sliding out of is holding clamp. this is not a show stopper but need to hold the torch before you press the button to switch it on.\n4: Does not come with an instruction manual.\n\nVerdict:\nAll in all this is an excellent product for people who like to go cycling when there is a chance that there might not be enough light or it might be dark,\nThe tail light is bright and functions in 3 modes which is nice. I would highly recommend this product, it is a must have for cyclists.\n\nPlease review the attached pictures and feel free to leave comments or ask questions and i will be more than happy to answer them.\n\nNOTE: I received this product at a discount for my honest review and trust me if i had bought it at full price my review would still be exactly the same.\n\nRegards,\nNick Hill\nA bad review is like baking the perfect cake with all the best ingredients and having someone sit on it!", "summary": "IN DEPTH REVIEW - Bike Phone Mount Kit", "unixReviewTime": 1448755200}

This durable solar panel is what makes this powerbank top all of the other powerbanks I own, the size is not huge like some bulkie ones or too heavy which makes it almost unnoticeable in My back pocket, it's about the thickness of 2 phones (I tested it with 2 oneplus two phones) and a bit wider and longer then the phones. I really like fact there is a place to snap a hook on it and carry it around you while it's going to keep charging as long as there is sunlight making sure you always have battery.\nThe plastic is super smooth and the hole thing feels very durable, the USB ports have a small led flashlight which isn't the brightest light though it will help you find the key hole to your door when it's dark outside. Charging time from empty to full on a charger took me about 6-7 hours, I didn't spend 6-7 hours outside yet but I'm pretty sure it will take a bit more then that with the solar panel, I did get about 30 minutes of sun that charged my phone though it did not have enough time to get it from 1 to 2 bars.\nOverall this Powerbank is made out of durable materials, looks great, Works like a champ and easy to carry around.\nI'm thankful I was able to receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased opinion and honest review\nSeller and Amazon were great and shipping was extremely fast of course.\nThank you for a superb service and product.", "summary": "Loving it, solar panel works great, very durable, good quality, lightweight, easy to carry around.", "unixReviewTime": 1448409600}

It clearly exposes the top and the bottom for better function ability. The volume control is also easy to use. The cut outs for the camera work well and no shadowing occurred in any of my photos I took. As i stated the top and bottom are fully exposed so those two areas are vunerable but it is important to keep the top open for connectivity and the buttom exposed for connecting to powering devices, stereos, and head phones, etc... The shell is hard with a rubber outer layer to cradle your phone and for a non slip feel. I have had quite a lot of smart phones and found less is more and to take care of my investment. Unless your in a work environment that demands a case that fully covers and has several layers of protective rubber and plastic all you really need is a $6.00 case and maybe a screen protector. I was looking around my office the other day and i noticed that some of our computers cost less than our phones and they never get dented or scratches that would lead us to buy protective wear for them instead we treat them in a correct manner. So we apply that same philosophy to our phones we invest thousands on. Don't stick your phone in your back pocket that is where your wallet goes and if you were not aware you sit on you bottom and that is where your back pocket is. If your phone is there it is going to get sat on. I bought really nice clutches for the ladies in our company to place their phones in and the guys got a screen protector and a simple case like this. A year later 22 out of 22 were returned as they were given and the leather clutches and simple cases were far less than any extreme protective case and accessories. I say again if you are in the line of work where you need a multilayered protective case than this case is not for you. If you are a parent with toddlers then this case may not be for you. But if you are a responsibile adult that knows how to properly take care of your investment in a smartphone this is perfect. No need to spend $80.00 on a case then another $15.00 on adapters so you can hook it up to a computer or sound system or anything for that matter. This case is just fine. I learned a long time ago less is best. Isn't that what these devices are made for to simplify our lives? Personally i don't use a case and all my phone are and have been well taken care of which has been a great return in investment due to reselling them after they are unlocked and I upgrade to the next latest and greatest.

One of my test run options was the Otterbox Commuter.\n\nLikes:\n- Good reputation - we've owned and been happy with other Otterbox products at our home\n- Solid construction\n- Rubber inner liner and button protection\n- Hard plastic outer cover\n- Rubber covers/protection for charging port, earphone jack port, etc.\n\nDislikes:\n- The cover made the phone feel a bit too bulky for my taste.\n- Outer plastic cover felt more slippery in my hand than my phone by itself - I kept thinking it was going to slip out of my hand.\n- Didn't care for the way the power on/off button seemed to be up under the edge of the plastic outer cover, and was not as easily accessible as I'd like.  It wasn't too bad it you reached around behind the phone to access the button, but it wasn't as easily accessed if you reached for the power button from the front side.\n\nFinal decision - returned the unit and continued my search for a better match for my personal preferences.\n\nI do not doubt that this cover would protect my phone.  There were just a few things, more personal than anything, that led me to keep looking.\n\n4 stars - but not 5 IMO", "summary": "No sale after a test run - there were a few things I didn't want to have to get used to.", "unixReviewTime": 1347494400}

I have just never seen something quite like this in any product I've bought in the past. I also like how simple the instructions were, quite brief, direct, and to the point, showing how to check the battery life, how to charge your device, and how to charge the battery. There is a QR code inside that will quickly direct you to more information about your product. Also, the instructions state a 30-day money back guarantee, 18-month hassle free warranty, and lifetime user support. This company is straight up astounding!\n\nThe battery itself is really slick looking and feels great in the hands, has some nice weight to it. The battery life indicator button has a good click to it and responds quickly to show your battery life. Only one side has your charging ports, one for charging the battery (clearly labeled as INPUT and takes a micro USB cable which is included with the product), and another for your device you are charging. Here's the good thing: this battery works with your iDevice as well as Android, and I have also tried a few other devices around the house like a bluetooth speaker, and it has worked fine. As far as charging, it charges pretty fast!\n\nIf you have a wife or girlfriend, watch out, because when mine saw this laying on the table, she said, \"Oh cool! My phone is about to die, can I take this and use it?\" I encouraged her to, and she really enjoyed how convenient it was to bring in her purse and charge her iPhone. This really opened up the possibilities of where to take it and when to use it. My father in law has one like this that he uses for hiking. When our car's charger is being used for the GPS, I can use the battery for charging up my phone.\n\nThis product is perfect compared to a lot of the ones on the market that, to me, just look cheap. They don't charge quickly, they don't work with all of my devices, and they don't always charge, plus the company I bought them from never really cared to know what I thought of their product. Anker, however, does care about you, and the quality behind this product shows they have been listening to their market.\n\nI got this product for free through their Power User program, and I was not paid to write this review. The product has really served its purpose over the past couple weeks and I do recommend it.", "summary": "Looks cool, works great!", "unixReviewTime": 1428969600}

I seldom ever drop my phones but since putting this case on it is a common occurrence. I am currently in the market for another case even though this one is only 2 weeks old.

Also, you could get an OtterBox case for the same price, but honestly, those things are over-rated, bulky, boxy...This product is not.  now, they call this a Convert, based on the fact that you COULD take off the silicon shell and plastic skeleton and just use the soft-touch plastic shell for your phone, but  you and I both know you're looking at this case because you want more than that.  Let me tell you, Seidio doesn't disappoint. As usual, this offers superior quality, and comfortability in design.  The case does add some bulk to the phone, but if you ask me, it's not too much.  it still keeps a sleek design, rounded off comfortably, and soft to the touch.  Your volume and power keys are covered, and with this model even your power port and headphone jack are covered by nicely fit flaps that seem to basically be sealed when closed.  If you're like me, you probably use YouTube, Netflix, or Google Movies on your phone, so you'll love the sturdy metal kickstand which is spring loaded for easy access.\n\nOne thing about this gigantic phone is that it doesn't sit comfortably in your pocket, and this holster is perfect for this.  holster is sturdy, locks the holding clip if you don't want the device to accidentally be removed...the only drawback for me is that the holster does not cover the screen entirely, but that's really not a deal breaker in my book.\n\nAlso, one nice little surprise I got is that Seidio included one of their screen protectors free with this product!\n\nanyway, I'm a big fan of Seidio products, and have used their Active case on several devices, but I wanted to step it up and get the Convert this time, which I am extremely glad I did.

The surfaces come sealed in an airtight, pouch that was easy to tear open, maintaining dust-free protectors from factory to application.\n\nThe application of the surfaces is about as easy as it gets for this type of product; cut to the perfect shape, these look great once they are on. The instructions suggest using the squeegee after the surface application to remove bubbles; I suggest using it during application. So long as there are no particles of dust on either the phone or the protective surface, the results are very nice.\n\nI am sure these protectors will keep the glass from breaking under many circumstances, but curiosity does not tempt me to prove anything beyond what Lifeworks has done in their product demonstration video.\n\nAlthough these protect the glass surfaces of my iPhone, the edges of the phone are as exposed as ever, which I knew they would be, I just wanted to test the product. I have dropped my phones before, and impact is usually at corners, so I do prefer a full-body protective case.\n\nIf I want to keep my phone compact, I will use Commando; the clear surfaces have lasting durability.

Netflix movies look great!\nA metal strip surrounds the screen, adding a nice touch of elegance. The plastic back has a leatherette texture which feels nice in the hand.\nInternet connectivity is good.  At home, the Dash found both of my wifi networks and easily connected. Once online, my browsing experience is smooth and effortless.  The powerful processor in this device is really evident when browsing, streaming video or listening to music. No buffering or interruptions.\nWith bluetooth on I easily found and connected to several different headsets.\nPhone calls are efficient and clear, although I wish I could boost the volume a bit higher. Its a bit quiet.\nThe sim card I used is a T-Mobile that I've had for about ten years - and the phone had no problem setting it up.\nI'm new to the Android OS, but found it easy to use and efficient.\nNote: This was not a difficult setup, but it was not a quick start either, as the battery was not anywhere close to being charged when it arrived. You need to fully charge before using this phone. Plugging in is simple - and there are indicator lights on the phone - a red one while charging that changes to green when charging is finished.\nBe patient: Using the included charger, mine took over 4 hours, after some false starts (there were a few warnings from the phone that my \"battery is too cold - please unplug from the charger\". For my second charge-up, I used the charger from my Lumia Windows phone - it charged the phone much more quickly. I've been topping up with a dc charger in my car and it works fine.\nAlthough this phone multitasks very nicely, be aware that the battery life is much better when you remember to turn off apps when you are done! I've noticed that apps open on shutdown reopen at startup! The Dash M. has a \"recent apps\" button right on the home screen, so its not hard to turn off apps when you're done. If you have a lot open there is a \"clear all\" option to close them all at once, a good idea when you are shutting down.\nOverall, I'm impressed with this phone.

I don't feel a major loss in resolution compared to a larger sized screen. The metal finish is attractive but I am still partial to the seamless look and feel of the Apple devices personally. That being said, the phone does feel very solid and high quality in its construction. The finish and glass screen seem durable, yet the curved glass may make it difficult for a screen protect to stay put.\n\nPerformance: The Snapdragon 820 is a highly rated processor and seems to run this phone quite nicely.  I am less partial to the Sony launcher and apps compared to Samsung and HTC, but thats a personal preference. The posted 3GB of RAM seem to be adequate and the battery life is also very excellent and on par with my iPhone 6S.\n\nAudio: Unlike iOS based iPhones, you gain a lot of flexibility with the Xperia in both apps and expandability.  The micro SD slot can accommodate another 200gb of storage.  Alongside the music player, which can accommodate lossless audio files (i.e. FLAC), you have a really amazing MP3 player.\n\nCamera and Display: The heart and soul of this camera is Sonys amazing 23MP rear and 18MP front cameras.  As expected (being a Sony camera enthusiast), they provide amazing photos in a variety of settings and are certainly a huge selling point for this particular model.\n\nA few features I didn't like:\nFull app/notification customization (you won't be able to turn off OS integrated ads easily)\nLack of Fingerprint scanner", "summary": "Small but powerful with excellent features", "unixReviewTime": 1475884800}

However, after I installed the product according to the instructions, (perfect alignment first try!) the top left and top right edges of the protector do not seal against the phone's screen. This is likely due to the curved profile of the screen, but will likely lead to dust and lint collecting under the protector, and eventually the unsealed section will spread out to the point that the protector will need to be replaced.  As this is a 2-pack, when the first protector wears out, I will attempt to place the second protector slightly further down (very slightly, as the home button is currently only about 1.6mm away from the protector.) in hopes that it will properly seal.

I am aware that it is difficult if not impossible to make a curved glass screen protector.  I knew this going in.  The major flaw I saw was that it is far too narrow and short and could cover more of the screen and NOT be in danger of ending up on the curved sides.  There is more than 1mm of space on the left and right sides if the screen protector is centered.  Further, there is several millimeters of space between the top and bottom of the screen if the protector is centered.  This caused dust/debris to accumulate at the edges of the screen protector at a pretty rapid pace and increased maintenance.\n\nThe perfect glass screen protector would take you to within .5mm of the screen edges on the sides and be a near perfect fit vertically.

Their customer service has been in contact with me a couple times to ensure that I'm happy with the product, but there have been no gripes.  Using the CD tray ensures that the phone is located in a place which doesn't take your eyes too far off the road, while at the same time being sure not to obstruct your view of the road like any windshield mount would do.", "summary": "Best phone mount for seamless integration and to avoid vibration", "unixReviewTime": 1456185600}

Price was four seventy nine for the 16gb version.  I found the 8gb version of this phone severely limited the amount of apps I could download. 16gb is perfect as I could download multiple 3D HD games like dead trigger, need for speed and ashphalt hd without filling up the phones internal storage.  I also purchased the i9205 LTE version from Amazon about a month ago but I had to return that device since it had some issues.\n\nI'm a Galaxy Note user who has had the note since September of 2011. When the Note 2 came out I decided to skip it because I didn't think it was that worthy of an upgrade. So the Note has been my primary device for almost 2 years.\n\nLike you, I discovered the Mega 6.3 and began reading up on it and watching video reviews online. My initial worry was that it wouldn't be as fast as the current flagships and that I'd regret buying a device with last years specs.\n\nMy reasoning to go ahead an purchase the Mega was based on the fact that to me it would feel like an upgrade since I was coming from my old Note.\n\nAfter using the Mega all my fears of it being underpowered and slow were gone. The device has a large bright crisp LCD display which I can now see clearly in daylight! The 1.5 GB RAM is handling my multitasking very well as I've yet seen a launcher redraw occur. The device is very snappy and has had no issues playing large MKV files. One of the coolest features that I was excited about was the IR port. Now you can control all your living room devices with your phone. The i9200 camera is on par with the galaxy note 2. For some reason the mega 6.3 i9205 that I tested had a poor performing camera. This i9200 performs much better,  not sure if different firmware is the reason. Either way I'm much happier with the camera quality on the i9200.\n\nThe big win with this phone is the sheer amount of real estate you get. The original Note fits within the Mega 6.3's display area. You aren't just getting a phone when you get a Mega 6.3 you are also getting a small tablet. This device is a true Phablet. While the Note 1 and 2 were big devices the Mega elevates the browsing and media viewing experience to a true tablet level experience. If this is what you are interested in then I highly recommend picking up this device. So to recap, this device has a great display, versatile form factor, decent camera and great performance.\n\nAnd I hope I don't understate that the battery life is AMAZING!. I'm used to phones beeping low battery warnings around 5-6pm. With the Mega I no longer have to worry about my battery life. I literally cannot kill the battery. By the time I hook up the charger at night its 11PM and the Mega still has 20% battery left. And this is with HEAVY usage. I can take the Mega off charger at 6am and still have battery left in the very late evening.\n\nIf you are trying to win the antutu, quadrant benchmark wars then I suggest you stay away from the Mega as the S4 is the current flagship which is putting up crazy benchmark numbers.\n\nIf you are looking for a large crisp HD display with last years flagship specs and excellent real world performance then the Mega 6.3 is your device. The only thing that should hold you back from this purchase is whether you want to wait for the Note 3 which will have the S-Pen, better camera and a 1080P display. The Mega 6.3 I picked up was the 16gb version for four seventy nine shipped from e bay. The unlocked international note 3 will start at mid $700's most likely.\n\nI can personally confirm that this phone (i9200) does work on AT&T 3G and 2G frequencies. My Mega 6.3 i9200 is running on AT&T 3G HSPA+. Unlike the unlocked Note N7000 and Galaxy S II I didn't have to enter any APN settings when I inserted my AT&T SIM. The Mega automatically defined the proper AT&T APN settings and the 3G was working great. You will need a MICRO SIM for this phone. If you have a standard sized SIM you can either cut it down to MICRO SIM size or visit an AT&T store and ask for a MICRO SIM.\n\nThe Mega 6.3 GT i9200 will NOT work with ANY AMERICAN LTE (4G) frequency. In North America we use LTE frequencies 700, 800, 1900, 1700, 2100 MHz which are bands 4, 12, 13, 17, 25\n\nAT&T uses BAND 4 and 17 Frequencies 1700/2100 for Band 4 and 700 for Band 17\n\nT-Mobile uses BAND 4 Frequencies 1700/2100 AWS\n\nThe i9200 has NO LTE radio so AT&T 3G HSPA+ is all you will get with the GT i9200 here in the United States. You will get 2G on T-Mobile or 3.5G HSPA if you are in an area where T-mobile has refarmed their 1900 band. This phone isn't compatible with Verizon.\n\n******************************************************************************************************ATT subscribers may ask themselves why should they buy the full price unlocked phone versus the $99 on contract Mega 6.3 that AT&T is currently offering? Well one major reason is that the AT&T Mega 6.3 has a locked boot loader. If you don't know what that means then you should get your Mega 6.3 directly from AT&T. However if you enjoy performing modifications to your phone such as rooting and flashing custom roms then the i9200 and i9205 are the only options you have with the Mega 6.3. You currently cannot root the AT&T Mega 6.3, please be aware of this if you are thinking about purchasing directly from AT&T and are hoping to root the AT&T Mega 6.3\n*****************************************************************************************************\n\nIf you purchase this unlocked international device from Amazon or any other online retailer and you live in the United States, Samsung will not warranty your phone. Buying an unlocked grey market phone that was not specifically released for your country (USA) is not eligible under Samsung's 1 year warranty. Please consider this before you purchase any unlocked international Samsung phones as they will not be covered under the Samsung warranty (It doesn't matter what the Amazon seller puts in the description about this). If you want a warranty from Samsung then either wait for your carrier (T-Mobile, AT&T etc.) to carry the phone or purchase a 3rd party warranty from a vendor like Square Trade.

She had gotten everything she needed and went up to the checkout, stood in line, loaded everything onto the belt and waited for the cashier to ring her up. Now my sister-in-law and I both will sometimes leave our purses in the car and just take our phones and wallets with us if we're planning to be in the store for quite a while and don't feel like lugging a purse around. That's exactly what she did that day. So when the cashier told her the total my sister-in-law opened up her wallet to get her debit card. It wasn't in there! She had forgotten earlier that she had dropped in into a pocket in her purse. Which was in the car. On the other side of the mall. I think you can image the rest and her embarrassment.\n\nNeedless to say I came across this iPhone wallet case and knew I needed to get it for her! It's perfect and she loves it, she's always got it with her now and is never without her cards, ID or phone. The strap on it is really handy to carry the case, she just wraps it around her wrist. It can hold up to 9 cards I think and one of the spots has a little window for her driver's license to show through. There's also no worry that the cards will scratch up the iPhone because the flap they are on closes and the side that actually touches the phone is flat with nothing on it. She does sometimes take the phone out of the case to talk on it, I guess it can be a little bit of a pain holding all of that up to your ear. Other than that she really seems very happy with this wallet case. No more forgetting her cards in the middle of the checkout!\n\nI am not affiliated with the seller or this product and am under no obligation to provide a positive review nor do I receive any sort of compensation one way or the other.

I have used the Otterbox Defender Series case for my iPhone 5s.  While it protects my phone, it is very bulky.  I have a number of New Trent products and have always regarded them as high quality and innovative.  So, I wanted to get the New Trent Ultra-Thin iPhone 5/5S case.  I wanted a different alternative to find something both rugged and very thin.\n\nI was impressed by the product when I received it.  It is much thinner than my Otterbox.  It is highly protective with 3 pieces, an outer soft TPU case, hard inner case and a polycarbonate interchangeable back cover.\nThe screen protector is integrated into the hard case and is scratch resistant and extremely clear.  It is very responsive to my touch.  I have used other cases that were not responsive.\n\nOne unique feature is that it has a thin protector for the fingerprint home button.  The Otterbox does not have that.  It provides extra protection, yet is still sensitive.\n\nAnother unique feature is a film over the microphone.  Again, other cases do not have that feature.  The film does not interfere with the microphone at all.  I like that protection.\n\nFinally, another unique feature is a protective film over the camera and flash.  I have taken pictures with and without the flash in the case.  The pictures are not affected by the film.  I like that protection.\n\nThis case provides water resistance, which is important for a protective case.  I especially want it for the iPhone 5s.  My Otterbox Defender is not water resistant.  When I go out in the rain, I worry about that. Also, when I take my iPhone 5s on a boat, I need that water resistance around any splashing.\n\nI have used this New Trent case and it seems to be durable.  The screen protector may get fingerprints on it over time, especially if your fingers are dirty or greasy, but that has occurred with every case that I have every owned.  It is no problem.  All you do is wipe it occasionally with a cloth and it is fine.  It seems to be more fingerprint resistant that many cases that I have owned.\n\nThis case is very thin and rugged.  Because of the water resistance and extra protection, as well as the thin form factor, I would rate this case as a 5 out of 5, with 5 being excellent and 1 being bad.\nThe only negative is that there is no belt clip.  I do like the option of a clip to carry it on my belt, although I often just put it in a pocket.\n\nI find that this product is especially suitable and helpful when I travel.  I need a protective and rugged case.  The occupations that would benefit the most from this case are people who travel, like sales people and consultants.  It would also be best for people around construction sites, like architects or contractors or people in the trades.  It would be good for real estate agents who have to go to different properties.  Although, I am a corporate finance professional, I find it useful for my travels as well as just going around town.  It is one of the best cases that I have discovered and I recommend this for anyone who wants to protect their iPhone.", "summary": "One of the best cases for an iPhone 5S", "unixReviewTime": 1395619200}

It is great! I've protected all my apple devices with otter box for many years and this is no different. I read about the \"air bubble\" problem with these cases and was a little nervous about buying one but I'm glad I did. When I first received the case  I put it on and was disappointed that it had a very bad air bubble just like the reviews said. But I contacted otter box and they sent me a new one and I put it on and found that it was better but still not perfect. So then I thought, maybe this screen protector I have under the otter box one is causing problems (I did it with my 5 and had no issues) so I removed it and boom, almost as good if not as good as the defender for the 5/5s. O and the case design is awesome and for those worried about the button pushing issues, don't be, just use a little pressure and or adjust the angle your pushing from and you will be fine.\n\nSummary: GET THE CASE! BEST THERE IS. ALWAYS WORTH THE MONEY. If you have a problem contact otter box and its solved.", "summary": "Great! Do not use with a second screen protector!", "unixReviewTime": 1418256000}

It seems to do what it says to do. I actually wish it were a little more rubbery to make me feel like it would protect the phone more against falls. It's more like plasticy than rubbery, though this is just my opinion. As others have said, because it's so protective, sometimes the sides of the touchscreen are hard to catch. This isn't a big deal for most users, but if you do have an app that might require regular touching of the edges of the screen, this could be an issue. Also mentioned what that the buttons are not accessible. This is not a good thing! One other thing that really got me a little skeptical, though this is probably just my on isolated experience, is that when this was shipped to me, the case it came it had somehow opened, and this case was all over my shipping box. It didn't affect the item at all, but first impressions are very important. I think they could have used more tape when packaging the item to avoid a very little, minor, and petty incident like this. However, image you buy this in a retail store and assume all the pieces are there, but when you get home there's something missing because it slipped out of the product box.\n\nOther than that, this is a very solid case. I think it's mist proof, but isn't waterproof (it doesn't claim to be, so don't try to test it out in the water).\n\nI received this product at a free or discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.

Having a small wireless controller like this would really add to the virtual reality experience in my opinion, however this sadly does not live up to my expectations. Pairing this device up is very simple and takes just a few seconds, however you will have next to zero functionality with this device. While the controller looks and feels okay in the hand, it doesn't actually do much of anything in any games I've tested. I've tried all types of games with this and in the best case scenario I've been able to control the volume by using the analog stick, and sometimes it will bring up a mouse cursor which ruins the immersive experience that virtual reality should offer.\n\nWhile I was really hoping that this would be an answer to what I think virtual reality should have, this product just falls flat on the idea. I would strongly advise anyone looking at getting into virtual reality and looking for a controller to add to the experience not bother picking this up as it is just a disappointment. I did receive this to test out and provide feedback on, but my review is honest. If you have any questions then I would be happy to answer them to the best of my abilities. To sum up what I like and dislike about this product, I'll list off the pros and cons below.\n\nPro's:\n- It looks like it would be a nice controller.. if it worked.\n\nCon's:\n- It does not work at all for any games, aside from sometimes turning up the volume it doesn't work with any of the games I've tested and I've tried a ton of them in hopes this would work. If you want a virtual reality controller that works then I'd strongly advice taking a look at another option.", "summary": "I would avoid this at all costs..", "unixReviewTime": 1463875200}

The material is a soft plastic/rubber which offers some basic protection from minor drops and falls. It comes with a stylus, which is great if you use them however there is no where to attach the stylus to the case so yo will essentially have to keep it in your pocket, if you are like me, you will probably lose it relatively quickly. The belt clip is swiveled so that you can have the phone in whichever position you prefer and is not very bulky so it is easy to get on and off of your belt. There is a lip on the clip to prevent it from just sliding off if you bend over or crouch down. The case also has a fold out kickstand for watching movies or videos or playing games.

I did a lot of research and was choosing between a Samsung galaxy s4 and the HTC one m7 to save money since I didn't want to pay $200 for the newest phone. I'm so glad I went with the HTC one. As a new user to smartphones, the HTC one was easy to navigate and walked me through personalizing the phone the way I wanted it. The processor is great and quick and the screen is big and clear compared to other phones. HTC really put a lot into this phone and keep getting better with their new HTC one m8.\nThe phone is light and I love having the speakers on the front instead of the side or back make watching or listening to music awesome and plus, I don't need to cup my hand around it to hear anything. I use a UAG phone case which protects it well and doesn't inhibit the speakers or use of the phone at all. I wish it had a sd card slot, but 32 gigs of internal memory is a lot, but with all the online storage programs available means I hardly use any phone memory.\nThe android store and program I think is better than apple's store. I have a chromecast too which works great when I control it with my phone. I highly recommend this phone to anyone wanting to save money and get a great phone.

It's not difficult to remove like some of them can be; it goes on nice and clean and comes off just the same, but it isn't loose or anything. Shipping was fast and packaging was equally satisfying, but for some reason the case itself had a lot of fingerprints on it (although it came in a sealed box). So I'm not sure what that's about - but I don't mind. It was easy to wipe off and that makes me think the case is also easy to keep clean. But the case itself is great, feels good in my hand, and I'll use it for some time to come!", "summary": "I would have purchased this one outright because it's super cute and lightweight", "unixReviewTime": 1435017600}

The area around the phone is reflective which I also did not know when I ordered. Anything that increases visibility is a plus, especially since I bicycle at night. About fitting the zune.

I was so surprised when I got them.\nWhat I want to say is that these 3 Feet cables are very high quality. The braided cable part makes me think it will last much longer than non-braided cables. I had purchased a cable of different brand before but my kids tripped over the cable, pulling it from the computer and bending the smaller end that connects to the computer. That cable had been a little loose to begin with and I was never completely certain that it was secure inside the charging port. This cable is completely secure inside the port and never feels like it will accidentally come loose.\nThey are supposed to be the fast charging USB and i have to say Im impressed! They charge both my GS4 and HTC with High speed rate. They are also pretty stable cables and the male to micro USB its sturdy and it fits just right on my GS4 not like other cables i have purchased in the past that are flimsy and they come off.\nThe braided exterior is tough to protect the cable, but doesn't add undue stiffness. It also allows it to slide around corners and edges more easily, so if you are using these in your car, you'll have less trouble with snagging on all the little things that cables can snag on there.\nOur Dogs loved to chew on my kids white Samsung tablet charge cords. She actually ruined 5 of them.  Got 10 colorful of these cable.  It's nice having different colors to choose from so the kids don't argue over whose cord is theirs. The cord that came with my Galaxy s4 wiggles around inside the phone port and gets knocked out very easily if the phone is rustled. This cord grips the port well and ensures a pretty quick charge too.\nThe adapters fit perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy S4, HTC and my 2013 Nexus 7 and i have had no problems.

I ride a large Harley touring bike with minimal wind behind the windshield. I would be very leery of putting this on a sport bike. I also find that you have two options - You can have the upper left bumper either strike and obstruct the volume up key or the volume down key....not too fun when streaming music to your motorcycle head unit.\n\nI am a fan of Ram products overall, but they should stop promoting this as a motorcycle solution. It isn't.  In my weeks of searching, I've concluded that other products aren't that good either. You can choose from an X grip that doesn't hold the device very snugly and obstructs your buttons,  or a pouch that causes your phone to overheat and reduce visibility on the screen.  If you search Amazon for, \"ram finger grip\" you'll see that lots of people seem to like this mounting solution better, but if you have a \"phablet\" like the Galaxy Note Series or  iPhone 6 Plus, you're out of luck because the \"fingers\" just don't open big enough. Maybe Ram will introduce a larger finger grip one day. Until then, I would avoid the X-Grip as a motorcycle mounting solution.

But it's got power, and that's for sure.\n3: Portability and Ease of Use\nThe iTorch is lighter than the iPhone (yes is can charge more than the iPhone. anything with a USB connector for that matter!) itself and comes with a handy carrying bag that you can stuff the iTorch, your phone or tablet USB attachment, and the iTorch charger in (at least I can, haha)! So you can take it anywhere with you just like you do your cellphone without hassle.

I set it every day to and from work, for which I usually have two choices of freeways to take, and it has always routed me the best way.\n\nThe battery finally gave way on my TomTom so I started checking around for a GPS that also had a 6-inch screen that would also include a dashcam, so I ordered this one made by Garmin.\n\nThe dashcam feature is great unless you want a dash mount instead of a window mount.  I tried several dash mount options, but since the camera lens only adjusts from side to side and not up and down, you end up with the hood of your car taking up quite a bit of the screen.  Yes, you can tilt the device itself to remedy this to some degree, but after doing this, to really adjust it properly, you end up with the screen tilted downward to an unacceptable degree for viewing.\n\nI ended up using the window mount it came with, which was okay, but I do prefer a dash mount.  However, even with the window mount the suction cup and the stem that connects to it was very visible on the screen, so that area is prominently visible with the video that is recorded.\n\nThe main reason I returned it, though, was due to its poor traffic assistance.  After turning it on, I would get a notification that it was checking for traffic information, which as stated on the screen, \"may take a while\".  It certainly did.  I was usually about a third of the way home (about ten minutes into my drive time) when it would finally kick in.  By that time I had passed the point of no return for my two routing options to get home, so it was fairly useless for my purpose.\n\nAdditionally, some of the directions and turn/exit/lane indicators that it provided just didn't make any sense.  I did download the most recent map and software prior to using it.\n\nNote that the traffic updates were coming from the Garmin app through my cell phone.  Once I loaded the Garmin app, it did an override on the HD digital traffic that it comes with that is received through the power cord, which BTW was also a bit sketchy.\n\nI ended up buying and installing a replacement battery for my TomTom.  It fires right up now just as it used to and gives me the best routing option for traffic in just a minute or two compared to the long time the Garmin took to do the same thing.  I also bought a separate dashcam.\n\nWhile I would like to have an all-in-one device, and while I could probably get used to the window mount and the less than desirable view on the screen, what I couldn't deal with was the time lag for traffic information and the occasional odd routing information.\n\nSo, from my experience I give it three stars.  Too bad, because it was so close, but for me it was just not quite there.\n\nHope my experience is helpful to some degree...thanks for reading!", "summary": "Not quite what I hoped for.", "unixReviewTime": 1505347200}

I like the compact, square shape  very easy to take along on the road without feeling weighed down. Its only about 4 inches tall and weighs only 2.4 ounces, so its easy to toss in a bag without a problem.\n\nThe case is all plastic but seems well put together, with tight seams. The input and output ports are well-anchored. It also has a lanyard of sorts (a small cord with a key ring at the end) which can aid in keeping this attached to something in a bag. But, if you don't like it, it can be easily snipped off.\n\nThis offers only the basic functions. Theres no power level indicator  just one USB output port (1A) and one micro USB input port. Both are located at the top end. Theres an indicator light to show it is charging a device. The light goes out when the device is charged or the powerbank is empty. Theres also an indicator that comes on when you plug the powerbank in to charge it, and it also goes out when the powerbank is full.\n\nGiven the small capacity (2600mAh) this is strictly for low-powered devices, such as mp3 players, phones, etc. Its not at all suitable for a tablet. Even with small devices, 2600mAh doesn't go far  basically one full recharge and the powerbank will be empty.\n\nBut, when you're low on power something like this can be very handy. The small size makes it easy to take along so youll have it when needed. Its not feature-rich, but for the price, its a great value.\n[Sample provide for review]", "summary": "Nice compact shape for a basic powerbank", "unixReviewTime": 1394409600}

Anyways, that protector covered the entire glass surface except for a few cut outs for the cameras, IR light and microphone. This caused a huge problem though for the proximity sensor apparently. So I went and got this one with a larger upper right corner cutout. It seems to have solved the problem, and sticks in the corners a bit better (not sure if it's because one corner now doesn't have to adhere). Pretty solid for what it is, and lifetime warranty as well. I've felt with Skinomi before on their warranty and they were solid in service.

Familiarize yourself with the items and steps I am going to lay out below. I have done so many brands of these and many brands more than once so I am going to list what one should have for the job and note missing items first.\n\n1. Wet Cleaning Pad\n2. Dry Cleaning Pad\n3. Microfiber Cloth - NONE, you should have a small cloth that is new or dust free for cleaning streaks after cleaning\n4. Scraper (Mainly for Tablets. Can Be Used on Phones Too.) - NONE, not really needed for a phone. Use your finger.\n5. Dust Stickers (Only if You Get a Speck of Dust Before Placement)\n\nThe best place to do these is where it is mainly dust free and where the humidity is a little higher than normal. The humidity is to help keep static down and being in a dust free place helps ensure none gets on your screen before you place it. One tiny speck will raise the glass in that one spot. If that happens to you, gently take the glass up and use a fingernail or something on that dust particle and drop the glass back down. When you peel off the protective coating on the screen protector is when you will get the most static. You can do it in the kitchen or shortly after a shower but no steamy fog, just a little humid so you do not steam up the glass. Static and dust are the enemies. The whole process is really painless and takes about two minutes in a perfect world. Take your time in the first steps, if needed, and when placing the glass, get it aligned and get it down. Implementing are as follows:\n\n1. For prepping, simply take off the case and old screen protector, if any.\n\n2. Use the wet cleaning pad to thoroughly clean the screen, especially if your screen was naked.\n\n3. Use the drying pad to take up excess moisture and pull up any grime.\n\n4. The microfiber cloth should be used to take any streaks away. Look at the device at different angles in the light to be sure you do not miss any so you have a pristine screen. Also, I had one cloth from a brand leave dust as I cleaned the streaks. If that happens, have a cotton ball or something to do the job.\n\n5. Ready to place! Have those dust stickers ready just in case a dust particle appears during this process. Peel of the film on the glass screen protector. That side goes down. Do not stop to admire it once it is off, just start to align it and get it on the device. The more time you wait, the more chances dust will have a chance to find you. Use the scraper on tablets and scraper of finger on phones while this begins to grab your screen. It is not a slow process so help it along from the middle outward.\n\n6. BUBBLE? I generally do not get any bubbles but sometimes a small one happens. Just gently lift the edge closest to the bubble(corners are easier) and push the bubble to the part you lift. Be patient and do not lift hard. The glass will actually bend and may not grab the screen so well after.\n\nOverall, it is real easy to do these and after doing about 30 or more of these, I follow exactly as I mention above. I even began walking friends through the process and they do it easily now. I hope it helps a lot. These glass screen protectors are smooth and if yours covers your selfie camera eye, it should be fine as I had a few like that and the images are just as clear.\n\nI received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.", "summary": "Good Screen Protector!", "unixReviewTime": 1466899200}

And this case is far more protective than most. It entirely isolates the phone, surrounding it with a barrier to water and dirt as well as to strikes on the pavement. Fairly easy to install, the only downside of the case is that there's now a bit of extra pressure necessary to activate the power and volume buttons. The mute lever is more easily controlled with the case than without it. The speakers work nicely through the barrier and the Lightning port is accessed by way of an opening door on the bottom of the case. I had no problem using standard cables and accessories through the door. There is very slight degradation of screen quality for viewing photos due to the added layer here, and occasionally I find that I need to touch images just a bit more vigorously than usual to activate or move something. Nothing you won't get used to quickly. In return, you can drop the phone into the fishtank, the snow, or onto the pavement from 6 feet and not worry. Just don't lose the little tool that comes with the case allowing the case to be removed. Getting the case on is easy without tools. Getting it off will lead to broken fingernails without the little tool. The Asphalt color is all business....no worries using this in any environment. I also tried out the Second Wind color, which remains very classy but adds a few touches of lime green around the perimeter, making the phone a little easier to find in a dark location. One final note is that the case adds a little heft, but some may notice the increased length and width; it's not a lot - perhaps 1/4\" more in each direction when compared against a standard case - but if your phone is already tight in your jeans pocket, this point might annoy you a bit.", "summary": "Highly protective without costing too much in the way of easy access", "unixReviewTime": 1487808000}

I would say between the two batteries the performance is about the same as 1 orignal samsung battery brand new. Update Today i went out to checky mail and in front of my door was a small box but I didn't order anything. I open the box and to my suprise it was two brand new batteries with a charger.

You can quibble over why they don't work: static on the connection, poor fit in the ear, or simply that neither the device user nor the person with whom they are attempting to chat with can hear each other. But the fact is that if ANYTHING interferes with the normal conversation experience, the device does not work.\n\nJust as simply, this device works. I can hear the people I am talking with and they don't even realize that I'm talking on a bluetooth. I'm not going to forget that I have the device in my ear, but the experience is close enough to talking into the receiver that the benefits of hands-free really shine.\n\nThis is not a device that looks cool. In fact, it is kind of gangly. But let's face it: until you see supermodels rocking blueteeth(?) (i.e. never), they won't be cool. So instead of a device trying to look cool, better to have one that actually works.\n\nFor anyone cannot afford to deal with all the issues that have plagued bluetooth devices in the past and who needs to have conversations unmarred by \"huhs\" and \"whats\" and finally by \"wait a minute\" as you take the poorly performing device out of your ear and start the conversation over, look no further.\n\nIt works well. In this problem plagued genre, that is saying something.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nEpilogue: Tragically, I washed the device with a load of clothes. Miraculously, it seemed to still work after being dried off--however, even though I could still hear what my callee was saying, they no longer could hear me. So, don't wash your bluetooth!", "summary": "Finally a mature bluetooth headset.", "unixReviewTime": 1285804800}

I was worried about doing that too often causing the loss of water-proofing, so I went looking for a magnetic charging cable that would allow us to let that port stay unmolested most of the time. Since we were using cases, we didn't consider a dock: most of the docks looked like they wouldn't work with the case. This was clearly a missed opportunity for Sony, since an integrated system of case and charging dock would have been preferred.\n\nThe #1 search result for magnetic charger on Amazon is the Magnector X. Hailing from Korea, the marketing copy looks great though the price seems high. It comes in a little case with a carrying pouch, and a little nub that connects to a usb cable and then attaches to your phone. The problem? The nub is wide, so the charging pins never makes contact with your phone if your phone is in a case. So we returned it.\n\nThe E-PRANCE cable hails from China, has 7 reviews, and doesn't qualify for Amazon prime. It ships direct from Shenzhen, comes through the postal service and takes weeks to deliver. It doesn't appear to have strain relievers on the cable, which means that if you jerk it too hard, it will break. Fortunately, it's a magnetic charging cable, so pulling on the phone means that the charger will just fall off the phone, so the cable shouldn't ever be subject to huge stress. In any case, it's cheaper than the Magnector X. To my relief, the charging end is thin, and easily charges both our phones while they're in their cases.

And this lamp fits the bill quite nicely. The reason why I purchased this one rather than the other lamps is the overwhelming positive reviews as well as the built-in functions and the style. So here is the breakdown:\n\nPROS\n\nExcellent style. The glossy white is very expensive looking. The bendable joints allows a good range of motion so you can position it under tight spaces or angle it in best way you like.\n4 kelvin colors. What can be best described as: white (reading), blue tint (studying), warm incandescent (relaxing), and orange incandescent (sleeping). I have been using it mostly on full blast at 'reading' and it has been awesome. On a few occasions I set it on 'relaxing' while doing graphic design and it really is easy on the eye balls and hardly noticeable in terms of distraction.\n60 minute timer. I'm guessing this setting would be useful to someone that leaves the light on when going to bed. Haven't really used it but it's a nice feature to have.\nEase of set up. I didn't read the manual. Just connect the light to the base, secure both units with supplied plastic washer and it's ready to go.\nNo heat. This is probably the biggest reason in purchasing a LED lamp. I have actually seen traditional incandescent lamp melting away the plastic shade and even the fabric shades when left on for too long. I put my had up to the bulbs and can barely feel any heat being emitted. Which means less energy is wasted. Heat = Energy\nTouch panel. All the controls are touch panel. No moving buttons or soft touch buttons to press. Awesome!\nBuilt in USB port in the side for your smartphone.\n\nCON\n\nOnly one draw back: the lamp can be a little wobbly at the joint where the unit is connected to the base. I thought maybe I didn't secure it well enough but as it turns out it's just wobbly. Not a deal breaker but would have liked it to be rock solid.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful LED lamp that now sits next to my iMac.

I knew the new G4 was coming out in a few weeks, but all the tech reviews online said this was a great phone so there was no need to wait. Since I was moving to Cricket Wireless (which runs on the AT&T network), I bought the AT&T version at full price and activated it on Cricket.\n\nThe phone is really sleek. Even though the screen is bigger than most standard phones out there, the bezel and body of the phone are so well crafted that it doesn't feel bigger. In fact, in my hand and pocket, it feels the same size as my old Galaxy S4 which has quite a smaller screen. Although I thought the placement of the power and volume buttons on the back was odd at first, I quickly realized that made much more sense on a phone and loved them. They were just in the right place for quick adjustments. Even better, the phone has \"knock on\", so to turn on the display when it's on a table or in a car dock, just double tap the screen and the phone turns on. It's an amazing feature that I love.\n\nBoth the front and rear cameras are pretty good quality. It takes pictures quickly and the results are usually pretty solid. The speaker is pretty powerful, much louder than any smart phone I've used before. Battery life is not amazing but pretty decent. It seems pretty on par with any other smart phone I've used.\n\nI would say the only negative to the phone is the software. The LG overlay and apps just feel a bit dated. Luckily that can quickly be solved by downloading alternate apps that look and feel better. I use Nova Launcher for my home screen and Textra as a text app. It does have a lot of AT&T apps on it that I'll never use, but that seems to be standard on all AT&T phones.\n\nOverall it seems like a great phone and a very nice upgrade from my old Galaxy S4.\n\n****6/29/2015**** - Update\nI removed one star because after a month of usage, battery life isn't as great as I'd like. While standby time is great, but when I actually use the phone, it goes through the battery way too quickly. Even with the screen dimmed down as low as is tolerable, it still burns through it pretty quickly. It may be better if you're using it on AT&T and running the newest Lollipop update. Because I'm on Cricket, I'm not able to upgrade the software.", "summary": "Great looking and performing phone. AT&T Version works on Cricket Wireless out of the box", "unixReviewTime": 1432771200}

I got it directly from T-mobile at the time for $200 with $50 prepaid minutes. I upgraded from the T-mobile Optimus-T. This was a HUGE upgrade from what I had.\n\nPROS:I love the screen and the controls. It is very peppy, equipped with a dual core processor. The colors are vibrant and the 1080P video recording looks great. The camera is excellent outdoors and so-so indoors. So far this has run pretty much every app I have thrown on it without a problem. I would easily buy this phone again. I love LG phones and consider them as good if not better than Samsung. My screen is much bigger than what you would find on an iPhone, but the resolution seems to be just as good (side by side).\n\nThe phone quality is excellent. It allows for 4G data, although you can specify 2G only or disable data altogether. The GPS works great. I currently use Co-Pilot for my GPS maps and GPS status for tinkering around. It also works great with Torque. I use the Bluetooth a lot and have no quarrels with it. The Bluetooth range is excellent.\n\nThe Wi-fi also works great. I use this phone without a data plan, so the wi-fi is a lifesaver when I'm at home so I can check my e-mail and browse the internet. Internet browsing on this phone is so good, thanks to a nice large screen, that I don't even use my computer anymore.\n\nCONS: My old Optimus-T allowed me to copy apps to the SD card, saving me on my limited 200mb internal storage. The Optimus L9 does NOT let you copy programs to the external SD card, which I though it could when I bought the phone. The 2gb internal storage is much bigger than my old phone, but it fills up very fast. I wish they had either put more inside this phone or allowed transferring apps to the external SD.  I understand this is a limitation put on by the Android ICS OS and not LG.\n\nIt WILL allow you to put music, pictures, videos and other files on the external SD card, so all is not lost. You can also set up the native camera and video recorder to put files on the external SD card, saving internal storage space.\n\nCONCLUSION: I would easily buy this phone again. The phone quality is excellent and it functions like a dream. If you need more internal storage, consider going with the LG Optimus G.

The case of course comes in two parts and they're easy to pull apart. The case features a roughly 2mm rise bezel around the screen so if you place your phone with the screen downwards there won't be any scratches due to your phone being raised ever so slightly.\n\nThe case looks absolutely stunning, I picked the gold one to match my phone and couldn't be happier! The case doesn't add much bulk and I can use the case for hours on end without getting any hand ache or any uncomfortable feeling.\n\nThe case cutouts are all in the right place and have been strategically cut. Spigen cares about their products and cares about protecting the customers devices. I have recommended spigen to quite a few friends and family members and have heard nothing but positive things from them!\n\nAll in all, the case is amazing. Protects your phone perfectly from bumps, scrapes and falls, makes your phone look amazing and doesn't add much bulk and weight to your phone.

SuperPak i2  Weighs about 4.2 ounces and measures 3.6 x 1.9 x 0.9 inches.  The i2 is compact and is easy to transport, either in your pocket or bag.\n\nThe UNU SuperPak i2 (5000mAh) is an Apple Certified portable charger that can charge any of todays mobile devices.  The included charging cable is also very cool.  One end is USB and the other is either a micro USB or a lightning adapter.  This lets us charge the i2 using a computer or wall plug (not included) and then flip it around and charge our mobile devices.  My iPhone 6 was able to be charged twice from one charge of the i2.  That is nice, especially when traveling or out for the day.  My iPad Air 2 received a 55% charge from the i2.\n\nThe i2 is available in both black and white models.\n\nOverall, the i2 is perfect for the everyday user that needs that extra power during the day.

When I open the outer box, there I see black TPU shell and by default the black Polycarbonate switchable/interchangeable cover/plate was already applied and two additional/extra (Silver & Golden color) switchable/interchangeable covers are provided. I followed the provided instructions to install my phone into the case (make sure your hands and phone are clean to avoid any dust getting into the case) and phone sits well inside the case and feels great to hold my phone and looks pretty classy.\n\nI can say this case is well engineered and rugged with double protection (TPU shell & switchable/interchangeable Polycarbonate cover or plate on the back of the shell) and this will sure to protect my phone in case of accidental drops and if the phone were to fall flat on its back much of the force was absorbed by the switchable back plate/cover. The case does not show the finger prints.\nOverall I am very happy with the case.\n\nPros:\nHave the built-in screen protector (Yes it is has screen protector integrated into the case)\nLight Weight, slim yet has great protection\nDurable & great edge protection\nFits well with all the port holes accessible\nFinally it looks great too for the eyes\n\nMy suggestions/ preferences:\nThe case is a little difficult to install but if you follow the instructions on the box then it makes job easier. Once phone is put inside, it is bit difficult to open up the case in case you wanted to clean any dust particles. So make sure your hands & phone are clean before inserting the phone into the case.\n\nThough I feel case is very comfortable to use, and allows me to grip my phone very well when using it, it feels much more comfortable to grip the phone without switchable/interchangeable back cover/plate (my personal preference).", "summary": "Incredible case!", "unixReviewTime": 1417737600}

I really like it but was always hitting the buttons on the sides of the phone as the phone case buttons are more pronounced with the case on. This is specially true with the volume up and down buttons. I read a review where someone cut these rubber extrusions down level with the rest of the case. This was very easy to do using a pair of wire cutters as snipers to just snip the buttons off of the rubber case. This helped a lot but I was still changing the volume unintentionally. So I used a small pair of sharp scissors and cut the button holes out all together leaving a hole in the rubber case where the up and down buttons are and the on off button on the right side of the case. Now I never hit these buttons by accident and I can still use the buttons pushing in through the holes in the case. This is the only reason I did not give it a Five star rating. In fact I like it so much I ordered another for my wife's phone and made the same modification per her request. We also bought clear tempered glass screen protector from the AT&T store to make our phone much more durable and less likely to be damaged. They are now like the OutterBox with the exception of the waterproof capability of the OutterBox which is not necessary with the S4 Active since they are somewhat waterproof. The OutterBox is way more clunky then these cases. So I would still recommend this case and recommend getting a protective cover for your screen.\n\nUPDATE: After owning this case for several months I have found that removing the phone from the case is quite a chore. For this reason I lowered my rating from 4 stars to 3 and if I had it to do over I would have just purchased the Outterbox case which already has the clear cover and easily disconnects from the belt holder.", "summary": "Nice Case but there are better", "unixReviewTime": 1396051200}

USB-C is a faster data and power rate cable the end is much smaller that your regular USB connector, It won't work with your Standard USB 2.0 or 3.0 slots, it does come with one \"Short\" USB 3.0 to USB-C cable which is backwards compatible with a USB 2.0 slot but charging time is waaaaaay slow. so If you can use a 3.0 slot with the USB-C cable then use that. In the mean time use the wall charger as often as possible.  Battery time is amazing one charge lasted me about 11 hours and i still had half he battery left.\n\nOn to the nano sim.

Once that was done, it was time to download my previous apps, because of the large amounts of space, mine is the 64 gig version, but in retrospect, it might have been better to spend the extra money for 128 gigs, my previous phone only had 8 gig and with the update to lollipop filled my phones memory by half.\n\nThis phone was so easy to work with, and because everything went though \"Big Brother\" Google all of my \"everything's\" was there so it was like moving into a bigger house with all my furniture inside.

Personally those are the same phone with differnt processors and memory. That's just my educated Opinon like faux news.

One device can be charged through built-in micro USB adapter, the second through a regular USB charging cable (not included). Each port provides 1A of power, the total combined current output for devices connected to this power adapter is 2.0A MAX.\n\nI tested Steepower 12W / 2.1A Dual-Port Car Charger with Nexus 7 Tablet (JellyBean 4.3) and Samsung Galaxy Nexus cell phone (JellyBean 4.2.2). I tested each on both ports, as well as both devices at the same time. The results were different on each port and now I plug them in only in one configuration which tested best. You will find the results of my tests in the table below.\n\nI own several car chargers and run the same set on tests on each of them, so they can be compared to each other using \"apples to apples\" comparison. This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit. My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test. I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.\n\nTo test this Steepower car charger I ran my 10 minute test on Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus phone on each of the 2 ports as well as both devices at the same time. I also tested using both a both a data cable and a charging cable as I noticed that Nexus 7 did not charge at all with a data cable (this is not the case with all car chargers). The data cable was able to charge the phone so the cable itself is functional.\n\nA quick note about the difference between a power cable and a data cable:\nCharging cables short the two data connections together (rendering them useless for data transfer), but this fools devices to see them as an AC power connection, and thus accept the higher current of the charging source.\n\nThis car charger makes a good contact with the car's power port. It did not wobble or got dislodged during our weekend trip on a number of unpaved roads when it was used to power Nexus 7 serving as a GPS. Its weight is 2.1 oz, it is 3.375\" long, and front of the plug is 1.125\" in diameter. The coiled cable is 22\" (unstretched).\n\n Nexus 7 Tablet\n--------------\nBuilt in cable -- AC ............. 2% change in charge in 10 minutes\nCharging cable -- AC ............. 3% change in charge in 10 minutes\n\n Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone\n--------------------------\nBuilt in cable -- AC ............. 6% change in charge in 10 minutes\nCharging cable -- AC ............. 4% change in charge in 10 minutes\n\n Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone and Nexus 7 Tablet at the same time\n--------------------------\nBuilt in cable -- AC ............. 5% change in charge in 10 minutes (Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone)\nCharging cable -- AC ............. 4% change in charge in 10 minutes (Nexus 7 Tablet)\n\n Key finding:\n------------------\nThis car charger worked very well. The phone worked best using the built-in cable and the tablet worked best using the charging cable. Since I did not expect the \"best\" port to be different between the two I re-run my tests several times and the results remained consistent.\n\nI received this charger from the manufacturer for testing and writing a review, be it positive or negative. I hope the numbers in my tests will help you compare different models as well as use this charger in the best configuration. Overall, I liked this charger and would recommend it.\n\nAli Julia review", "summary": "Performs well with Nexus 7 Tablet and Samsung Galaxy Nexus cell phone", "unixReviewTime": 1378512000}

I have received the product and it looks great. Appearance is really nice. This product is exactly as described. The fit is perfect. They have an awesome grip to them. It does seem to provide a ton of protection for the phone but it still helps keep it away from scratches. The phone snaps into the case very easily, and snuggly, and is also fairly easy to remove. The design has very beautiful graphics design, which gives the case an upscale, fancy feel to it. This might be the most attractive case I have seen. The craftsmanship is truly on point. It doesn't add much weight and it doesn't make the phone feel bulky in any way. It works wonderful by providing protection from drops, scratches, scrapes, and bumps. The buttons are very easy to press through to and have great response with minimal force needed. The cut outs will fit most standard chargers and headphones. This case is very easy to put on my phone and to remove. My phone is completely protected with this case. The case fits nice and snug. I am extremely happy with this case.\nThis is a great product.

While it's not quite perfect, it's about as close as any case I've tried (and I've tried TONS).\n\nIt's slim. One of the qualities of the iphone 4 I like is it's slim form factor. A lot of the cases out there add so much bulk that I may as well be carrying around a home phone with wall charger attached. This one keeps my iphone looking like an iphone in all respects. It has just enough of a lip around the front that it keeps the glass from contacting when you set/drop it on the floor, but it doesn't impede full use of the touchscreen. A lot of cases i've used/tried would take up a decent chunk of that slim border of glass on the side between the edge and the screen. It would not allow me to actually touch and use the edges of the iphone! this one clips to the metal band, not around the glass, so it's fully open :-)\n\nOne of my favorite aspects: they have scalloped out the back end of the case where the volume and mute buttons are. It's one of those things that you realize after you've had a case like this that you know you couldn't go back to having it any other way. It's nice because when you're using the phone, you don't have to poke your fingers IN to where the buttons are, they're easily reachable and activated but sneaking your finger/thumb around from the back end, which is the end you come from to use the buttons anyhow. It's a nice touch.\n\nThe one knock I have against it is that while it has what they call a \"velvet soft finish,\" I wish it was a bit grippier. It has SOME tac to it, but I'd like it to be just ever so slightly \"rubberier.\" I've only come across one other case that was closer to the grip I like which was the incase slider IN RED, even every other color of that case line is just as slick as this case, for some reason the RED incase slider has the most tac of any case I've felt.\n\nAnyhow, despite that one knock, it's otherwise the perfect case for me!", "summary": "Best snap case for iphone 4/4s", "unixReviewTime": 1337040000}

I consulted with the owner who was very prompt at getting back to me and also very helpful. He explained the battery in the bigger iPad Pro is over 10,300 mAh and the Impower Charger is 11,000. Thus, it will do it, but he suggested some good options:\n\n1) Make sure the Impower is fully charged.\n2) Don't let the iPad Pro 12.9\" go below 25% before I charge it.\n3) It would be better if the applications are shut down and not to use it when charging. This is because if using it, it will draw juice and the battery is large making it more difficult to charge it.\n\nThus the optimal way to use the Impower with such a huge device is to either shut it down or at least close all the applications and wait for it to recharge. This has worked, though it does take longer to get to a full charge which of course is expected.\n\nThe reality is, I don't lug my iPad Pro around just anywhere and expect to have to plug it into a portable charger. It generally keeps a long charge anyway. Normally, electric is available and it gets plugged in when necessary and charged; though it is good to know in a pinch I can use this portable charger for it.\n\nThis charger was obtained so that I could use it for my iPhone when needed which has been known to go down and leave me in a lurch. I also have an older iPad4 and the Impower has charged that just fine.\n\nThe unit itself charges up quite quickly and I rather like the blue light that comes on when the button is pressed and shows the progress of charging. The unit as two USB ports on it and they can both be used at the same time. It is equipped with a short unique cable that is also equipped with adapters for various devices.\n\nWhen this arrives to protect it from scratches, it has two pieces of film on it. One on the top and one on the bottom. These are easy to remove. On the top, there is also a tight fitting piece of plastic to keep the area in good condition. This plastic on the top requires a little bit of probing with one's fingernail to work it up just a touch and then it will easily peel off. Once all the film and plastic is off a very shiny black finish is revealed and is truly like a piano finish. It is very nice looking.\n\nThe unit is a bit heavier because of the bigger battery. I believe the web page states it is 9.3 ounces. It is heavier than some portable chargers but it also has a hefty battery in it too. There is a pretty velvet bag included in which the unit can be placed along with the cable. This bag is equipped with fancy well-made drawstrings that have a small bead on each end. This is a nice looking bag and is well made and doubles as a way of wiping the fingerprints off that nice piano finish when needed. I am satisfied with the unit for the purposes I intend to use it for.\n\nI was given the opportunity to review this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "An Attractive Powerful Portable Charger", "unixReviewTime": 1468627200}

I read a lot of reviews before I bought it and they seemed to vary between people who thought it was amazing (the majority) and others who saw it as a dud. One thing I did notice is that the positive reviews seemed to come from people who'd only owned it a couple of days whereas the negatives were coming from longer term users.\n\nFor that reason I decided to leave it a while before writing a review so I could get a picture of how it really performed in the day-to-day environment. My initial reaction was firmly in the \"Wow!\" camp. There's a lot to love about this phone: the impossibly thin form factor, the gorgeous 720p AMOLED screen (more than enough resolution at this screen size), even the little Star Trekky blip noises it makes when you input commands. I felt like I'd been transported into the 24th century compared to my previous phone, a first gen Moto G (which never missed a beat and is still in use today BTW).\n\nAfter a few weeks use I started to notice some foibles. The relatively anemic, in use, battery life I could live with because I work from home a lot and I have chargers in my car etc. but things like the weak GPS locking were a pain compared to the boring reliability of the Moto G. Again, also while navigating with Waze, after about an hour or so it would constantly give up and reset, as if it had absorbed too much data and just couldn't go on. Kinda like a stick-thin super model refusing to eat all the way through a 32 ounce T-Bone steak.\n\nThe last straw though was when it started dropping calls. I have a friend whom I call most days and we usually chat for half an hour to forty five minutes just passing the time. One day I called her cellphone and the call just kept cutting out. The time was still running on the dailler but we neither could hear each other. At first I thought it was her annoying habit of leaving her phone on \"make calls over wifi where available\" mode (I don't know why she does this as she has unlimited minutes but maybe she thinks wifi calls are even more \"free\"?). Anyhow I asked if she wouldn't mind switching that out and I redialed her, cellular to cellular. Same thing happened. Now she does live in a sketchy signal area near the beach so I tried once more, this time to her landline. Same thing again, not very encouraging. I rebooted the phone and it worked fine for a few more days and then with the dropped calls again firstly with her, then to another friend's landline, then to yet another friend's cell.\n\nAt this point I realized I had to send it back. That was kind of like breaking up with the world's most gorgeous babe because you could no longer ignore the fact that they're clinically insane. But, seriously, I'm in the rental property business and I need people to be able to contact me 24/7 if the need arises. It rarely happens but I need to be there when it does. I can't have a phone that keeps cutting out when people are trying to convey important, maybe life-threatening information.\n\nI logged on to return the phone only to realize I'd passed the return date by one day. Even so, I placed a mercy call to Amazon explaining my situation and that I would definitely be buying another phone from them and they agreed to accept the return in exchange for a gift card credit which was fine by me.\n\nI've already ordered a replacement, the larger Blu Vivo XL. I didn't really want such a big phone. I already have a Samsung Tab S 8.4 tablet with AMOLED screen. I was really looking for something that could translate that experience into a smaller more portable form. Set up with the same apps and screen savers etc. the two really did look like mother-ship and shuttle craft. The XL is getting so close to the tablet in size that it almost makes one of them redundant. That would most likely be the tablet as I, obviously, can't make calls from it.\n\nThat said I still need a phone. I'm thinking that considering the GPS and call drop problems, maybe it's something antenna related? Maybe it's really hard to pack all those electronics into such a small form without shielding and interference issues?\n\nEither way, I sent it back.\n\nFarewell you beautiful thing and don't forget to take your meds!", "summary": "Beautiful and dangerous to know!", "unixReviewTime": 1463097600}

The best device screen protectors are made from durable material that will protect your screen from more than just day-to-day bumps and scratches. Whether the screen protector is thick or thin, it should be hard and scratchproof. It should also resist fingerprints and germs.\n\n2. The design of the device screen protector is almost as important as its durability. If it peels up, collects dirt around the edges, gets in the way of your device case or interferes with how your finger interacts with the screen, it probably won't last long on your device. The best screen protectors for models are smooth under your finger, responds to your touch and doesn't leave you feeling like your finger is floating above the screen  regardless of how thick it is. It also comes with a cleaning cloth to help you get all the fingerprints, oil and dust off your screen before you apply the device screen protector.\n\nI am happy to say that this screen protector pack has met them!

We have amazing apps and programs that help us complete tasks efficiently and sinc up on our devices, allow us to keep up with friends and family and so on. All of this saps the battery of our phone in addition to the way it slows with age. Portable chargers are a must anymore. This 5000mAh from Aukey is a nice option. The cylindrical shape is easy to hold and the finish is nice. The pink color is really cute. I noticed it could be unscrewed at either end, but could not see any purpose for that.\n\nThe one thing that would make it a five star, and I feel this way about all external batteries now that I know it's an option, is to have a built in cable/connection.  It can be a hassle to keep the charging cable together with the charger, getting tangled in your bag and so on. It's just more convenient to have it connected! I would love to see that feature in the future. Otherwise it's a great item and the price is super reasonable.. The variety of colors make it convenient for families also, assigning each person a color. What do you think?\nI received this batter for free to review and as always the opinions in the review are my own!", "summary": "A necessity these days!", "unixReviewTime": 1467504000}
