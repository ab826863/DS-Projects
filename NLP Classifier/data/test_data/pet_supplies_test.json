The TSA were very nice and understanding. And the process went without the cat escaping into the airport.\n\nThere were a couple of times when our cat was obviously unhappy during the flight, but overall he did fantastic. He slept mostly and had plenty of room in the Sherpa.

Our dog wore them only while we were traveling in a few separate occasions, a little over a month in total. The rest of the time we stored the tags in a drawer.

I have worried about their hips since they have a tendency of having problems with joints, especially hip dysplasia. I have had multiple goldens with these ailments and I am trying out make sure my current goldens do not have the same problems. I have tried the powder, liquid, and pill version, but our dogs are not a big fan of most of them. We go through so much glucosamine for our dogs since I have three around 100 pounds. It seems like anything I buy does not last very long and I feel like I buy a new bottle of glucosamine for my dogs almost every week. This can be really pricey, but I know that they need it with all of the hip and joint problems.\n\nWith this Gillick K9 glucosamine, I give each dog around 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) each day and there are 32 fl. ounces (1 quart) of glucosamine in the bottle. My dogs can always tell which Amazon box has the treats in it and they were eager for me to open the package. Even though I couldn't smell it, they could smell it through the bottle and were very excited to try it. When I opened it, (it took a long time to get the seals off) my dogs were really excited for it. It does not have a very strong scent and it is a thick yellow color. This bottle does not come with a pump or a pour out cap. You have to unscrew the lid and guesstimate 2 tablespoons. When you pour it, it runs down the mouth of the bottle and has to be wiped. I wish it had a pour cap or pump because it would be a cleaner way to use it. When you are done with this, you just have to throw it in the refrigerator to store.\n\nI am happy with this product especially since it is made in the USA and has glucosamine, msm, and chondroitin which help to promote healthy joints and movement. The other ingredients include: 100% pure alove vera juice, purified water, natural flavoring, citric acid, stevia, potassium benzoate, potassium sorbate and shellfish. This does not contain any surgar, starch, salt, wheat, gluten, yeast, milk, or soy derivatives. I would ideally like a product that didn't contain stevia, but my dogs love it regardless. On the back of the bottle it says that the statments haven't been evaluated by the FDA. The product is manufactured in a GMP facility. The bottle is BPA free and it is made in the USA! My dogs are able to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle without joint pain thanks to glucosamine!\n\n I hope that this review has been helpful to you!!!", "summary": "Made in the USA, doesn't smell, 1 quart, my dogs love it!", "unixReviewTime": 1471996800}

It was great for one of them and not so good for the other.  I'll describe both their experiences and hopefully that will help you decide whether this product might be right for your own cat.\n\nMonkey: He is a lovely long-haired kitty with a tendency to get soft stools.  I notice, because it gets stuck in his fur.  There's not always an obvious cause for his problem -- he's resistant to eating anything other than his own food, and he never goes outside.  But about a week of FortiFlora clears the problem right up, each and every time.  There's been a time or two he's been on antibiotics, and FortiFlora has helped keep his stools firm then, too.  He loves the taste and gets very excited whenever I get out one of the little packets.  So it's been great for him.\n\nMouse: She was a sweet little short-haired gray tabby with a bad case of inflammatory bowel disease.  We used this product for awhile, but it did not help.  In fact, it may have made the problem worse.  FortiFlora contains something called \"animal digest\" that is designed to enhance palatability (and seems to, in Monkey's case), but which is likely to contain some animal proteins that aggravate IBD symptoms.  (If you are not familiar with feline IBD, many common proteins may trigger symptoms -- including, in some cases, chicken, pork, beef, turkey, etc. in addition to grains.)\n\nIn conclusion, if you have an otherwise healthy cat on a course of antibiotics or with occasional soft stools, you should definitely try FortiFlora.  But if you have a cat with a food allergy or with IBD, you should probably not use it.  Also, don't open the packets around your own food (the powder is light and can puff up a bit when you pour it out) and wash your hands after dispensing -- the bacterial strain is an Enterococcus one that you don't necessarily want in your own system.", "summary": "worth a try, but not suitable for every cat", "unixReviewTime": 1371168000}

I have no way to know.  And, I will say that you cannot always judge a dog's heritage by its appearance ... I have met people with mixed-breed dogs where I was SURE that the dog was, for example, a lab/pit mix, and the owner will say \"no, I saw both parents, it's a border collie / doberman mix.\"  Or two breeds I absolutely could not see in the dog.  So, keep that in mind when you get unexpected results!\n\nMy own dog Cassidy is long haired, red and white, and she blows her undercoat like a Samoyed or Husky.  I have always thought she was an Australian Shepherd / Siberian Husky mix.  Her DNA came back as:\n\n25% Golden Retriever, 25% Akita, 25% Giant Schnauzer, and then one of her grandparents was a mixed breed dog, with the five breeds with the strongest statistical probability being, in descending order: Border Collie, Portuguese Water Dog, Basenji, Bearded Collie, and Samoyed.\n\nI can see the Golden, especially in her plumage.  Other people can see the Akita (I cannot), and there's no trace of Giant Schnauzer in her appearance.  She could definitely be part Border Collie rather than Australian Shepherd though.  And she blows her coat like a Samoyed!\n\nSo ... the one thing that gives me pause, however, is the idea that three of her grandparents were purebreds and very expensive ones at that, and somehow they managed to mate outside their breed?  I mean, I know that if she's 25% Akita, it's possible that she had two grandparents who were each half-Akita, but that's a pretty rare breed, so it's more likely that one grandparent was a purebred Akita.  And - I can't see an Akita owner just letting his dog mate with some random Golden Retriever, Giant Schnauzer or mixed breed dog!\n\nAnyway, in terms of customer service, I was pleased that the kit includes a postage paid priority mail envelope.  I got the results about two weeks after sending in the swabs, and the on-line PDF (which you can download and/or print) was very nicely formatted.  I somehow lost the email and then it turns out I never created an account, so I called the 800 number and the customer service rep looked up my name, and gave me my sample number, and two years after buying the test, I was able to enter that data and download the PDF to my computer, something I should have done at the time. I could also give that information to my friends and they could look up my dog's results if they wanted to.  So - this is a mix of commerce and science, I believe, and is only as good as (a) the size of the data bank they have and (b) the number of alleles they test.  And obviously the more they test, the more costly it is for them and the less money they make.  So it's a balancing act for Mars Veterinary - to provide good results while still making a profit.\n\nAnyway here's a picture of my Cassidy - tell me what you think?!", "summary": "Fun, maybe accurate, quick turnaround, glad I did it.", "unixReviewTime": 1423094400}

We have two of them and I'm about to order two more. We were previously using Scoop Free with the Forever Litter tray, a fantastic system that had kept us happy for over 10 years. But one of our new kittens simply would not adjust to the crystals. We had to switch to clay (when she was old enough). Fortunately all of the cats are happy with the clay. Even better, I'm actually happier with the clay than I had been with the crystals. We're using the Petco \"So Phresh\" clumping clay litter which comes in a bucket you can refill at the store. All 5 of our cats prefer this litter over the crystals so we've had to switch to it in all of the boxes. The only problem we were facing was litter getting sprayed all over the place. When I saw the shape of the corners of these boxes, I was concerned about scooping and thought it might be difficult with the curves. However it has been no problem at all. We've been using the boxes for almost a month now. There is minimal tracking out the front, easily mitigated by the little rug we have in front of the boxes. The Petco litter has really surprised me by being such high quality. There is no smell whatsoever. I had switched to crystals because of their superior odor control, but the Petco litter is doing an incredibly good job. No smell. And the clumps are quite solid. It's very easy to scoop them out even when they are up against a curved corner in this box. We do scoop every day. We keep the litter about 3 to 4 inches deep. We use a Litter Genie which is a product I only wish I'd discovered earlier. We have one gigantic long haired cat, and I thought this box might be too small for him, but he seems to be perfectly fine with it. We have one much larger box in another location closer to where he spends most of his time, but he still goes downstairs to use these boxes quite often. In case you are concerned to hear about clumping clay litter and kittens, don't worry, we didn't try the clay until they were quite old enough for it to not be a problem. (Clumping clay litter can be bad for little kittens as they can ingest it when cleaning themselves and it can block their digestive system.)", "summary": "Great litter box.

I like that this has the front clip if we need it (which we sometimes use right now - it's Autumn which means the squirrels are in high gear and have complete disregard for my dog, who would love to 'play' with them) and I also love how high it sits on his neck. It is a little bit difficult to get on and off, but my dog doesn't mind. I also like how it stays away from areas of high motion, such as his armpits, shoulders\nand chest. It seems walking in this is more comfortable for him, as his previous harness impeded his gait slightly. Another thing that I love is the ID tag pocket - I like that I don't have to have my dog wear his collar, as he does not wear one when we are in the house. I didn't love how he had to wear one with his old harness.\n\nI chose this harness above the Web Master as I needed something where he could not escape out the front - he has never been able to back out of a harness. I was skeptical that the Medium would fit him - he is a bigger dog so typically he wears large, but this fits him well. My only concern is that the back portion of this harness might sit up too high, but it's minor (half an inch, maybe) and does not affect the fit and purpose otherwise.\n\nWe are now working hard to get my pup back to his old self, and thanks to the Ruffwear Front Range Harness, it's a little bit easier. I no longer fear the reliability of the equipment I am using, which allows me to focus on rehabilitating my dog.

The fleece is soft and warm and they're made very well. I've had no problems laundering them in the washing machine and the dryer in both, hot and cold cycles, without any problems.

Unfortunately, my cat doesn't seem to like it as yet. I haven't given up as yet. I think he didn't like the feel of those pellets as he is declawed. I wish I hadn't done that to him, but we got him at a time when we had another cat that was declawed and didn't want the new guy to have an unfair advantage. So I have read MANY of the reviews. I have thought about the various changes to the pellets, and decided that something smooth and easy on the paws was what I should try next. I have removed the pellets, and put sifted pea gravel in place of the pellets. Sifted because there is some material that is sand and tiny size that must be removed. My rational is I will probably scoop the poops (if he will ever use it) very soon after he goes anyway. I have been in the habit of cleaning his litter box out daily anyway. In this process I have let his old box go unscooped for several days at a time- till I couldn't stand it anymore (YUCK). After the pea gravel change he was at least interested enough to go smell and look at it. I think he might have #1 in it, as there is a stain on the pad underneath. But then I couldn't tolerate the AWFUL unscooped poopy box and cleaned it out. This probably set me back again! Now I am letting the pile build up again in hopes he will go back to the nice new pea gravel box. I am hesitant to totally remove his old box as I don't want an accident. My son who bought the same system did that as his cats wouldn't try this new box either. His cats \"figured it out\" when he took away the old box.

Before finding the Kool Collar, my dog couldn't run in the heat at all.  I had to wait for dark to run her. Now we can go while it is still daylight. It doesn't completely keep her cool due to the rapid melting of the ice/warming up of the insert, but it gives her at least 20 minutes of not overheating.  I have started bringing along a second insert, carrying it in a little cooler on my bike so that I can change them halfway.  That gives us extra walk time.  Well, run time, LOL... she likes to go!\n\nI prefer the insert to the ice.  The ice is very bulky and my dog didn't seem to like it.  Using it with the insert, she enthusiastically sticks her head through it when I hold it out. Happy dog! Oh, also, the collar is very lightweight, unlike some of those \"bandanas\" that are offered for dogs.\n\nUPDATE: The little ice inserts didn't last long - they leaked and became flat and useless.  So I ended up using real ice, which worked once I figured out the right amount to use so that it wasn't too tight yet would have enough ice to last for at least 20-30 minutes.  Now I prefer the ice as it did get her neck good and wet, promoting evaporation and thus, cooling.  Here in Florida this product is invaluable.

However in spite of proper feeding/care our 6 year old Beagle developed bad tarter on his back teeth and our vet advised cleaning as soon as possible.

Using twice a day for less than a month he has nearly puppy-white teeth. I did brush the back teeth a couple of times to loosen the plaque with seemed helpful.  Once I saw the product was working I started using it on my son's Puggle too with excellent results. The 2.2 ounce bottle lasted 6 weeks, spraying the Beagle twice daily for the first month and once every couple of days after that. I am so impressed I ordered an 8 oz refill for myself (for less than I paid for the original small bottle) and two other bottles for my daughter's and sister's dogs. I can't wait to take my dog back to the vet and tell/show him how effective this product is.

She has unflinchingly gone out in all sorts of weather, including hurricanes and we have never had a problem.\n\nEarlier this year, however, we adopted a rescue dog with a real fear of water.  Just looking out the door or window on a rainy day makes her miserable.  When we take her outdoors in the rain, she acts as if she thinks she is made of candy floss and will melt if she gets wet.  She is a long haired Maltese mix and looks absolutely miserable with the long strands of wet hair hanging in her face.  Although we put a raincoat on her, she cant see well with a hood on so she shakes it off and then suffers the consequences.  Holding an umbrella over her has always been a tricky prospect, especially if I have both dogs out.  At times, I have had the water pour off the edge of my umbrella right into her face :(\n\nWhen we got the Lesypet umbrella, it was during a sunny rain free week.  I tried the umbrella leash on her while indoors and, except for an initial bit of confusion about what I was trying to accomplish, she had no problem walking under it.  When the rain came back this week, I was so eager to try it and it more than met my expectations.  This umbrella is just ingenious.  Its transparent so she can clearly see me and the world around her while staying dry.  The cane shaped umbrella handle is easy to hold even while holding another dogs leash.\n\nWe highly recommend this solution for any other dogs who absolutely hate rain coming down on their faces.\n\nDisclosure: A complimentary product was sent to me for trial and evaluation.

I had had her on a different food for the first couple of months after I brought her home, and while that food (Innova Large Breed Puppy) resulted in appropriate growth rate and energy level, she ALWAYS had mushy stools.  It didn't matter whether I fed her small amounts at a time, whether I added pumpkin, whether I added yogurt, or anything else.\n\nAfter giving the other food a chance for a couple of months, I decided to try something else (after confirming, of course, that my puppy did not have a bacterial infection or any intestinal parasites).  I had a list of brands in mind; Wellness was one of them.  Since it was the only food from my list available in a large bag from the store where I was, at the time, that's what I bought.  I made the switch slowly, over the period of about 10 days.\n\nAbout a week after my puppy was on the Wellness exclusively, I noticed her stools had started firming up.  (That may be a little gross to talk about, but it is something I was quite concerned about since I have to pick up after her!)  After a month or so, they're now completely normal (my baseline being the last dog I had).  My puppy also has an appropriate amount of energy on this food, can handle a lot of it (she's still growing!), has a beautiful shiny coat and bright eyes, and is gaining weight at an appropriate rate.  She likes the taste and empties the bowl in a short period of time.\n\nThe food comes in a resealable bag for freshness.  It is one of the more expensive dry puppy foods on the market, but I think it's keeping my dog in such good shape that I'm saving on vet costs.

Chaffer", "reviewText": "I just received this item today.  I took it out of the box and took it apart to see what I am working with.  So here are my thoughts on the actual product.  Yes, as other viewers has stated, it is made of foam.  It is high density foam, not the kind coolers or plates are made of.  The material makes it light enough to not be difficult to handle, it feels sturdy and is firm but comfortable at the same time.  I unzipped the cover and checked it out.  I like that it can be cleaned easily.  The pillow/cushion in the seat is a lot thicker than I thought it would be and it seems like it will be very comfortable for my dogs.  I got the large seat and have a 10 lb poodle, and a 10 lb chiwennee and they both fit in the seat and would be able to move around and lay down comfortably.  The only thing I can see I would improve on is I wish the leash went into the foam instead of just being sewn into the cover.  Seems it would be safer.  But it is still safer than my tiny dog laying on my leather seats when some jack hole pulls out in front of me and I have to slam my breaks and send him flying into the floor board (which happened recently).  Luckily I caught him before he could hit the floor.  So I am glad I made the investment and I think I chose the right product.  I will update when my dog has actually had a chance to ride in it.  He has a vet appointment on Saturday and I will know then.\n\nUpdate:  I finally got the chance to use my booster seat and I love it.  My boy dog Jax loved being able to either lie down and sleep (like he always does when riding) or stand and look out the windows (which he never gets the chance to do)  I put blankets in it  because it is cool out here in Coastal GA and the smell of familiar items kept them comfortable.  My girl dog was not crazy about it, but she hates to ride.  That is not a reflection of the seat, but her own stubbornness.  I got the large and it was plenty of room for both of them to sit or lay.  They are 9 & 8 lbs. and fit perfectly.  The seat was easy to install in the center of my back seat.  I had to tweak the seat belt a little because I drive a Volvo and all of the seat belts have shoulder straps and it wanted to lift the right side of the seat.  After putting the seat belt together with a zip tie, it sat flat down.  I love having this product and am glad I invested in it because it keeps my babies from flying all over the car when making turns or putting ion the breaks.  Having them ride comfortably and safely keeps me more focused on driving and less focused on their safety or worrying about where in the car they are.", "summary": "Great product so far......", "unixReviewTime": 1454198400}

The sodium levels for this food was actually way lower that the food I has prior. What she did tell me is the food she ate prior was a grain free food, and this brand HAD GRAINS! We figured it out! She was so helpful and amazing. I then remembered that reverse sneezing, allergies, and bowel movements was why I put her on grain free food in the first place. Unfortunately I just bought the new bag and I didn't want to waist it or return it so my dog finished the bag. I know better next time.

I have to wonder if it actually contains what it claims to contain on the label. I don't see how there could be such a significant difference in the effect is there is similar amounts of the same ingredients (compared to the other joint chews mentioned). After just one week on the Synovi G3, there is a visible improvement from what was seen on \"Triple Joint Max\". If you do find your dog has some relief from this product, please try the others as well. You may, as we did, see a significant improvement in how your dog feels and behaves.\n\nI am dedicated to research and cross checking what I think/feel to be the truth. I have never been more sure that a product is not worth it's price. For 10% more money, you can receive a lot more relief for your pet. Don't you owe them that? In the months that we experiments with  the more affordable joint chew, we saw serious degeneration. Because we had a donation of several packages, we tried the \"1-800-pet meds\" brand joint ches in higher than recommended doses for 4 months (her decline seemed fairly steady for about 3 months then remained about the same). I then tried \"Triple Joint Max\" for about 5 weeks. During that time she did not improve. In just 3 months, the dog we were treating with the \"cheap\" products deteriorated rapidly. It was so bad, she was screaming in pain at night. This dog went from being able to walk 5 miles with no issues, to only being able to walk 1/2 mile slowly. A switch back to the Synovi G3 showed significant improvement in just a week. At this rate, I would expect her to rebuild her muscle and be able to handle 4 mile walks within a month.\n\nEven though I know Synovi G3 works, I am open to seeing if there is indeed something that may be better. For this dog, I am going to switch to the Dasuquin chews for a few weeks and see what happens. I will report back.\n\nUPDATE: The Dasuquin chews<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dasuquin-Soft-Chews-for-Dogs-60-lbs-and-over-84-Chews/dp/B0030VH496/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dasuquin Soft Chews for Dogs 60 lbs and over, 84 Chews</a>&nbsp;are wonderful!! I give them 5 stars! The dog has  improved drastically in only 1 1/2 weeks. Today we walked over a mile at a fast speed and she showed no desire to stop and rest. She even wanted to play in the park at the end of the walk.\n\nJoint Chews I've used, listed in order of effectiveness:\n1) Dasuquin Chews (By far the Best)\n2) Synovi G3 (pretty darn great)\n3) Glycoflex 3 (pretty darn good)\n4) Triple Joint Max (Not very effective)\n5) 1800 pet meds super joint chewies (not effective from what I can tell)\n\nGood Luck to all the dog lovers out there!\n\nPS A raw, carb-free diet is great for arthritic dogs.", "summary": "Not nearly as Effective as...", "unixReviewTime": 1283472000}

Previously, my dog has had two harnesses -- one that's a nylon, leash-like material and another that's a soft mesh like this one.

The colors are fantastic.  My dog has a bit of a blockier head than Mom's dog, and sometimes, he doesn't want to put it on because it's tight around his face going on.  Please note: it DOES NOT squeeze his head -- he just doesn't like things touching his face.\n\nMy only complaint is the clasp.  My harness is still working great.  I've machine washed it and laid it flat to dry several times, and it holds up wonderfully.  The clasp, however, is a little flimsy, and sometimes, you REALLY have to squeeze it to release it.

I've got a short-hair and a long-hair. This works great for both. It doesn't damage their coats at all.\n\nShort-Hair Cat:\nThe slicker brushes and the rubber ones never got much from my short-haired cat leaving hands, clothes, and furniture covered in little orange hairs. This de-shedding tool gets enough off of him that it has dramatically decreased how much loose hair ends up everywhere from him. He also hated being groomed by every other brush or tool I've tried, but this this barely bothered him at all - he was apprehensive at first, as he often is of new things, but once he sniffed it and inspected it he let me groom him just fine.\n\nLong-Hair Cat:\nThe wire slicker brushes had decent luck with my long-haired cat, but they always caused his fur to become static-y. I'd groom him and he'd look worse than he did before I brushed him. This tool left his coat much softer than a slicker brush ever has, and got more hair from him. While not totally static-free, there was far less of it with this comb. It also seems to irritate his skin much less than other grooming tools have, as his dandruff has improved with the use of this comb. Also, he loved being groomed with this. Purring and sleepy-eyed the whole time.\n\nWhy 4 Stars?\nI docked this comb by one star because it gets the hair everywhere as it's combing it out. The comb doesn't trap the hair very well, beyond a small amount, which you have to pull from the tines by hand and pile up, where it will hopefully not drift off or get everywhere before you're done grooming. There was so much more hair flying around when I combed my cats with this tool than there is with a brush... but again, it also worked better at actually de-shedding.\n\nOverall:\nAbsolutely a good investment, especially at the ~$15 it was when I bought it considering other similar tools can run $30+.", "summary": "Great tool, a little hairy during the grooming process though", "unixReviewTime": 1492041600}

I stay with my mom (she's 91 & suffers from Alzheimer's) in Seattle, half of the week and I've been doing this for over 3 years now. As anyone that acts as a caregiver (unpaid) to a family member knows, it is a stressful, emotionally draining, physically exhausting and downright dirty job. It's made even more difficult when the person becomes incontinent and it's not something I'd ever thought I'd sign up for. Ever since my dad died, 'us kids' took it upon ourselves to start caring for her and since Day 1, I've been taking my cat Buddy with me on my 'days on'. I really don't know how I could ever do it without him. He is truly my BFF and constant companion. I feel so blessed that he likes riding in the car with me. It's so cute, having him sitting alongside of me, on the center console, looking around and out the windows. Still, he has accidents on occasions (very few) and I decided it's best to cover the seats. Especially after I had to take over my daughter's car payments, after she moved abroad. This car is an '05, but it's still a very nice car, and I want to take good care of it.\nWhat I like most about this particular backseat cover, is the fabric on the top side, the side that your pet lays on. It is so soft and velvety to the touch. It really does feel (and look), like suede (what they call micro-suede) and Buddy really like laying on it. It comes with it's own nylon drawstring carrying bag, for when you want to store it away, but I'll probably use it for some of his other supplies. I also like that this cover looks so luxurious. I honestly think it looks too nice for me to put on the back seat of my car, especially when I have the litter box, sitting over top of it...lol! But that's just there for 'just in case' he has an accident. I actually had this cover laid out over top of my bed (when it first arrived), and Buddy took to it instantly & lay right on top of it. It's so soft and feels good against the skin. Another good thing about it, is there's no factory/chemical 'stink'/smell to it. On the reverse side, the material is obvious to the eye, to be waterproof. It's made out of Polyester and has those little rubberized nub/dots on it. The stitching is very nice and I like how the whole thing is quilt stitched to keep the fabrics sewn together. There are 2 corners with elastic straps across them and 2 without. Along the top side, there are 2 adjustable buckle straps to use to attach to the backseats' headrests. And in the middle of the cover, are 2 velcro sealed openings, for in you want to use your car's seat belt. I think this is perfect for any pet and if he/she has an accident, this cover is totally machine washable (hang it to dry). It can also be wiped clean with a rag and some pet spot cleaning spray. I received this for free, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but I think the asking price for this product is still quite reasonable. It's a wise purchase and definitely better to protect your investment (your vehicle), just in case your pet should have a messy accident.", "summary": "This is a great product for protecting your car from pet accidents.", "unixReviewTime": 1463529600}

But as for my name, address, etc, which is the main information someone would need to locate me and return my cat, is cramped and so tightly spaced, it is difficult to read. Since my cat is indoors-only and I keep careful watch over her, I think it is unlikely she will escape. She's also has a microchip, although where I live, the vets charge people who bring in lost pets to read the chip! Most people just walk away, rather than pay. I can't say I blame them.

A subsequent, similar test with the same bubble bath diluted to 0.5 percent in water produced no visible findings that were attributable to treatment.

While she didn't prefer to use them, I did enough training to know that she could use them just fine.  They are rated for a lot more than 40 lbs. and under her weight the steps appeared to be stable.  They were very easy to assemble; make sure you don't see light between the pieces to get the best result.  There is a tip in the instructions about using dish washing liquid to lubricate the pieces so they snap together better; that was very helpful.  You might also want a rubber mallet or hammer to help.\n\nAs many other mentioned, the steps do slant a bit.  My dog did not find this to be a problem, especially during training when there was a treat to be had!

Slime with streaks of brown, and today what looks like a clear egg case, very sticky and about the size of a pea.  What that is, I don't know but it worries me.

I put the litter bin in the corner of the cage and filled it with the litter.  In 2 hours time, I noticed my guinea pig was using it and I thought, \"Wonderful! Now the cage bedding will last a few days longer!\"  However, in a couple of days, I noticed each corner of the cage was being utilized for evacuation.  I normally clean the cage 1-2 times/week as there is only 1 guinea pig (Wilson) and was really hoping the litter box would allow me 1-2 times/every two weeks, of course with normal emptying of the litter box.  That is where the problem lies.  I went in 1 day later to empty the litter bin and noticed the pellets had become quite mushy; almost clay-like.  I gave the cage a thorough clean and bathed my little piggie and found his poor little paws were caked with the wet cement remnants of the pellets.  I had to soap and and soak his little claws and manually clean them out.  No wonder he stopped using the litter bin after 1 day.  I think it works to direct the guinea pig to evacuate in that spot, however, you will have to empty and replace everyday and that can get expensive...  I decided to finish the bag of litter and have chosen not to buy it again as the regular cage filler works fine in his litter bin and he prefers it as he has been using his litter bin 70% and the corners of his cage 30%.  If you are going to try this litter, you should change it at least once a day (depending on how much your little cavvy eats) because as soon as they empty their bladder, the pellets will turn to mush and it is not fun to clean that out.

It is not an alternative to solid obedience and behavior training. That said, it has done wonders for both of my dogs. I was lucky that they both fell into the 80% of dogs that are helped by DAP. To give you an idea of how DAP can help, here are the stories of my two dogs:\n\nHobbes is reactive and gets over excited easily. He used to bark at cars when we went on walks and would stare out the window all day barking at people walking past. We joined a class based on the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Control-Unleashed-Creating-a-Focused-and-Confident-Dog/dp/B000UCF53A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Control Unleashed: Creating a Focused and Confident Dog</a>, which teaches dogs how to calm themselves. Despite great progress, he was still having some troubles, including lunging and growling at people when he was scared. Our instructor recommended we start using DAP in addition to a Thundershirt and calming music. The improvement over the first couple weeks was so gradual that it was hardly noticeable. Overall he was calmer and happier, no longer barking as much or lunging at cars on walks. However, after 4 weeks when the diffuser ran out there was a distinct and abrupt worsening. He was on edge again and more apt to bark. When our refills arrived, he quickly calmed down.\n\nIvy had been an outgoing, playful dog until a month ago when she suddenly became scared of going outside after several days of skateboarders using our street to practice their moves. She hid all day long under the bed, and we had to carry her outside to go potty because she refused to go on her own. The vet started her on Prozac, and incidentally we started the DAP for Hobbes around the same time. After a month, she seemed to be getting better, more willing to come out and play. We weren't sure if this was due to the meds or the DAP. When the DAP ran out, she was suddenly back to hiding all day long and refusing to go outside. With the refill, she will now come out and play. She still has a long road to get back to her previous playful self, but it's an improvement.\n\nWith both dogs, we used a variety of training techniques and other comfort measures:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Thundershirt-Dog-Anxiety-Treatment-Large-Heather-Grey/dp/B0028QK6EY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Thundershirt Dog Anxiety Treatment, Large, Heather Grey</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Through-a-Dog-s-Ear-Music-to-Calm-Your-Canine-Companion-Volume-1/dp/1591796423/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Through a Dog's Ear: Music to Calm Your Canine Companion, Volume 1</a>.\n\nAnyone who thinks that they can solve a dog's fear problem with one product without any training is going to be sorely disappointed. DAP can take the edge off of the fear so that training can be effective.", "summary": "Works well as adjunct to behavior training", "unixReviewTime": 1337212800}

I bought it again and the new trimmer is much smaller and barely cuts hair between my dogs toes at all.  Since my previous review was a glowing five stars, you know I would give credit if credit was due.  I was tempted to give it two stars, but \"I hate it\" really covers my thoughts on the new one I just tried out today and am sending back ASAP.\n\nPrior review:\nThis product is a trimmer (translate that as 'shaver') for dog hair.  I have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and hair grows on her paws between the pads.  The main benefit of this particular model is the T-shape; it allows you to get between the dogs toes and pads effectively. .  If you need something to groom your dog all over, this isn't it.  It isn't designed to groom your pet.  But if you want to clean out between the pads and toes, then this is just the ticket.\n\nRead on if you don't mind my meandering style...\n\nIf my dog's underpaw fur is not trimmed (shaved) off, then she slip-slides around on the wood floors; when it gets too long, she doesn't want to jump down off furniture onto the floor by herself.  I had been using a rechargeable men's beard groomer for the 1st four years of her life, which worked OK because Cavaliers have very soft fur.  It was tricky to try to clean out thoroughly between the pads, though, because it was not designed to perform that maneuver.\n\nWell, that rechargeable battery wouldn't charge anymore, so I bought this corded model.  Since I don't walk around while trimming the fur, cordless is pointless and less powerful anyway, so I wanted a corded model this time.  I considered a groomer model, because it sounded like a good idea to get something with more power plus attachments for just a few dollars more, but then I thought about it; I only need to do the paws and the T-shape looked like it would get between the paws and the toes BETTER than the groomer models would.  Not surprisingly (ha-ha!), I was right.  I paid about $2 less at a major Arkansas-based retail chain, but I would have gladly paid the extra two bucks for delivery if I hadn't been going there anyway.\n\nI don't know how long it took for the product to get hot for the reviewers who said it did, but I did not have that problem at all.  Not the part I held and not the blade.  But Cavaliers are small, only 18 pounds, and have soft fur, so maybe if you had a really BIG dog or cat that could happen?  But frankly, that doesn't seem to be the problem the negative reviewers had; it seems like they were trying to groom their pets with a trimmer.  If you need to both groom your pet and ALSO to clean out between the pads and toes, I think I would look for a model with the T-shape on at least one blade or else buy a groomer AND buy this trimmer.\n\nFinally, the noise of the trimmer is a buzzing just like an electric shaver.  It isn't jarring but it is not \"whisper quiet\" either.  My dog hates the vacuum cleaner, but this didn't bother her.", "summary": "Edited review: [NOT] Perfect for cleaning between pads and toes", "unixReviewTime": 1352419200}

The aggressive kitty had been attacking the sick kitty for about a month and a half I noticed. The vet suggested Feliway to put the aggressive kitty at ease since she said he probably has anxiety due to the situation and a built up frustration of no longer having a play mate to wrestle and play with.\n\nSince I've bought Feliway, the more aggressive cat is more relaxed and I haven't witnessed him attacking my sick kitty. He now has resumed to grooming the sick kitty and laying and sitting beside him as he always did in the past. They calmly get along again. The positive change has taken place since I've bought the Feliway diffuser.\n\nDoes not last 30-days though and the plug-in adapter is always very hot when I unplug it from the wall.", "summary": "Harmony among kitties again.

Now to my dog...if I am home, that means that I am there to play with him and entertain him and walk him and love him. My boss, on the other hand, would prefer that I spend 8 hours a day working on deliverables for our clients. Until my dog and my boss can come to an agreement, I have to do what my boss wants since in the end, that is what keeps the kibble coming.\n\nI have quite a few doggy-puzzles in this house so that I can work in peace. The Hide-a-Squirrel was great but eventually was destroyed. Bones are great as long as you can supervise. Kongs are probably the greatest invention for dogs on the face of the planet. I read about the Squirrel Buddy and Kibble Nibble when I was getting ready to buy a Tug-A-Jug.  I tend to give one puzzle at a time so the dog doesn't get bored. I haven't tried the other products yet, but for the Kibble Nibble:\n\n1) My dog is on large breed Iams puppy. His kibble is average sized, not too large. The kibble came out at an acceptable, easy pace but to make it last longer and keep him occupied I chopped up some carrots and put those in as well. The larger carrots help slow down the flow of kibble. At the end, I just dump the carrots into his bowl and then wash the toy.\n\n2) It holds up well to his pawing it around and even dropping it off of the sofa. However, he has tried to chew on it to get the treats out and this definitely was not meant to be a chew toy (teeth marks appeared quite quickly!). When he starts gnawing on it, I take it away from him since usually that's when there's nothing left. I think he could make quick work of destroying it if left alone.\n\n3) The way you adjust the flow of kibble according to the box is to cut off the little prongs on the inside of the ball that hold the kibble in (it's the same with the squirrel buddy) The only problem is that once you do that, you can't put the prongs back!\n\n4) It is pricier than some of the other toys.\n\nBasically, it costs a little more and it doesn't seem able to stand up to chewing like a Kong. But the way that it moves and rattles has been very different and fun for the dog.  I would definitely say this is worth keeping in the house if you need to keep your pup occupied when you are doing something, but I wouldn't recommend leaving him unattended for the day with this since an aggressive chewer could probably destroy it pretty quickly. For that, I'm sticking with a frozen Kong or the squirrel dude!\n\nOh and one other thing--I bought all the large sizes of these toys for my dog, and they are all the same color! (I guess they use color to differentiate between sizes). That's okay but I do wish they were different colors. We have way too many purple toys in this house.\n\nUpdate 6/2013:  Some of the plastic bumpers have worn off, but the toy has still held up okay!", "summary": "Finally...some peace!", "unixReviewTime": 1263427200}

I think if you're on a budget and/or buying food for a animal shelter or providing food for strays that might normally starve, Friskies is a good alternative (to providing nothing), but I wouldn't give this to my family member...\n\nOriginal Review: What can I say other than he eats it if he gets hungry but I almost always see leftovers when I leave it out all day, so he's not particularly in love with this. A lot of vets seem to now recommend not leaving pet food out all day (because if they're indoor cats and not very active, they can get quite fat), but instead establishing feeding times (in morning when you get up, early evening when you get home and then just before you go to bed, then you put the food away after 1/2 hour out each time).\n\nAnyway, after I run out of this, I'll end up doing what some animal specialists recommend, and that means mixing a high quality grain free canned and  bagged dry cat food (that has real meat and fish as the primary ingredients and not rice). They also suggest mashing in steamed veggies (broccoli, carrots, zucchini) and some leftover meat or fish I have for myself (chicken, steak, salmon), but we'll see how long I can keep that up.", "summary": "Price using S&S made it worth it, but cat isn't  crazy about it.", "unixReviewTime": 1381708800}

You can add/remove them as necessary. It's very easy to do, you just squeeze and pull the prong you want to release and then measure to dogs neck. The quick release feature is awesome. It allows you to attach/detached collar quickly so you're not giving your dog extra anxiety messing with him. The loop that you hook the leash on swivels so that way it will move with you instead of against you. Some similar collars don't do this. The prongs do not hurt him, they simply get his attention. Please be sure not to pop/pull the leash too hard. Start softly and adjust accordingly. I practiced on my arm to get the hang of it before I put it on my dog. This is designed to help maintain their attention, not hurt them! Overall this is a great product. It gets my dogs attention quickly and he is learning so well!

I recently fed my kitty the Friskies indoor again.  She eats both the Friskies and the Purina One products with relish. I was prompted to explore the differences between the two brands. There are many sites which rate cat food, but I found few if any which put two products from the same manufacturer at different price points side by side.  The Friskies product is a pate, while Purina One is chunks in gravy.  That difference makes no particular difference to my cat, but it might to yours. Let's look at the ingredients and nutritional levels, as shown by Purina's own information.\n\nFriskies indoor lists the first six ingredients, following water as: chicken, liver, meat-by-products, rice, corn bran, spinach.  The ingredients for Purina One, again following water are: chicken, liver, wheat gluten, meat-by-products, fish,  corn-starch modified.  The first two ingredients are identical while the Friskies in fact has a third element with nutritional value, the by-products in place of Purina One's wheat gluten. Of course this does not take account of different proportions, which are not given in the ingredient list.  In addition, Purina One has by-products as its fourth ingredient and also includes fish as an element of nutriment. There seems to be a slight advantage to Purina One in terms on nutrient content.\n\nNow, let's look at the analysis of vitamin and mineral content, again using Purina's information.  Friskies shows the following:  protein: 7%, fat 3 %, fiber 0.95 %, moisture, 78%, taurine 0.05%.  For Purina One, the figures are: protein 11 %, fat 2%, fiber 1.5%, moisture 82%, and taurine 0.07.  In addition Purina One breaks out the nutritional content of 1-carnotine and omega 6 fatty acids, which are not shown separately for Friskies.  the Purina One product has a higher level of protein, fiber, moisture, and taurine as well as a lower level of fat.  Thus, it appears to have a substantial advantage nutritionally over the Friskies.\n\nThe above comparison suggests that Purina One is substantially more nutritious than the Friskies.  I can't asses whether the nutritional difference is sufficient to justify the price differential.  The Purina Product which comes in 2.9 oz tins is more than twice as expensive, for two cans, as one can of  the Friskies which is sold in the larger 5.5 oz can.  Both products are described as nutritionally complete for adult cats.\n\nThe preferences of your cat and your budget will likely be the determining factor in deciding between the two brands. I will continue to use the Purina One for the chicken portion of kitty's diet, but I will use the Friskies as well for occasional variety and to reduce overall cost.\n\nRobin Friedman", "summary": "Friskies Indoor Chicken and Purina One White Meat Chicken Healthy Metabolism Compared", "unixReviewTime": 1428969600}

Chapin", "reviewText": "When my Mastiff was a puppy, he got one of these as a gift; when I found out what they cost, at first I thought they were overpriced.  He removed the rope part within ten minutes, and I figured he'd have the soft ball in pieces shortly thereafter, as he has and had a business-like attitude toward toys.  It rolled easily across my tile floors, however, and he tired himself out chasing it and pouncing on it, and went to sleep, leaving it in a corner.  The next morning, however, I gave it 15 minutes, as he was after it and 'caught' it every few minutes, puncturing the surface so that the ball whistled.\n\nFast forward to Chico as a 5-year-old; his favourite puppy toy is still his favourite, although it now resembles orange peel with the toothmarks, has myriad small holes and a couple of larger ones, and is no longer completely round. The ball has survived countless hours of hard play including being thrown and retrieved, teething, falling into the pool, being left outside in Nevada summer sun, washed with cleanser, and occasionally being sat on by a dog who weighs over 200 pounds, as well as bitten every time it is 'caught'. I bought him a new one for his birthday, and he loves it as much as the old one, but you can tell he's no puppy any longer -- he has left the rope in this one. I changed my mind -- this ball is worth every penny, with or without the rope. He has larger Jollies and one smaller one, ones with handles and this one with rope, but if you can only buy one Jolly ball for your big dog, this would be the one!", "summary": "Worth it!", "unixReviewTime": 1335398400}

I took a little time to get around opening the box. When I did the assembly was easy. However the parts that hold the battery from releasing kept falling out. I think this was due to the store getting a pallet of leftovers. I eventually put it together and the little wand when around all the way about two times and then decided to stop forever and just wiggle back and forth a little bit. This was still enough to keep the cats occupied. I would find the cover flipped up in the little wand every once in a while missing. It would always turn up in some obscure place and I can always put it back in.\n\nBecause this critter was so cheap I decided to take a second chance. This time though I ordered it online. As cats will they help me open the box. This time I knew what to do so I did not need to read the instructions. To my surprise I found the plastic in the battery holding compartment warped. Now I know that this company can care less about quality control (Made in China.) However after forcing the batteries in and applying the math and setting it down, the critter went to work right away, wheeling this way and that, then stopping a second and anticipating that cat's next move. Soon the whole menagerie was around it. One cat would walk off and pretend he didn't care; the next minute he would be sitting on the cover. Even cats that don't get along found themselves cooperating in dispatching the mysterious wand. In the second attempt the batteries even lasted longer.\n\nIt does work well on carpets and keeps most of those little feline critters from bugging you every five minutes to play. However it had no effect on the claim to stop clawing and scratching; luckily I have one of those triangular cardboard scratch pads.\n\nThis critter uses three C cell batteries that do not come with the product. I replaced them three times in a month; so I suggest bulk purchase.\n\nSo why the good rating? Because I can now read my book in silence. I do not mind missing the lap cat that reaches up just as I am getting engrossed.\n\nI suggest you buy two also and keep one as a backup.\n\n====================\nAdded on 3 MAR 14\nOrdered again (came from a different vendor)\nI was willing to buy this animal again as it served its purpose but was cheaply built.\n\nThe outside box was the same but the innards were a surprise.

She weighs almost 60 pounds and was found as a stray so she has never had any formal training.  I started her on a regular collar and leash walk and she was not walking with me well at all.  I next moved to a harness and while she began walking better, she would jump, bark, and lunge at other dogs as we walked past.  I believe she has a bit of a leash aggression that we are working on to fix.\nI finally put her on the gentle leader.  Although it was a bit difficult to fit to her head correctly by myself, I did get it to fit correctly.  She hated it the first hour it was on.  She was constantly trying to get the nose part off and would not walk at all.  Training her to walk with it correctly was a little difficult but we worked on it for an hour and half or so.  She finally began to calm down and was walking properly with me within the hour.\nI took her for her first morning walk on the Gentle Leader this morning.  I live in an apartment complex with many other dogs and she has been really difficult to control when we get around the other dogs.  Today though, she was a completely different dog.  There was no pulling, no barking, no lunging, nothing.  She was even able to sit next to me as I spoke to another woman in my neighbor with a lab as well.  It is like night and day.  It truly is amazing the difference the Gentle Leader makes. I highly recommend anyone getting one.\nAs a quick note, the Gentle Leader is NOT a muzzle.  While it goes around their nose, it does not act as a muzzle and will not prevent biting.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2013", "summary": "A Miracle Worker!", "unixReviewTime": 1374796800}

But every motor in existence makes noise...\n--If you have a dog like mine you might get more water tracked from it, because its deeper than a normal bowl and he likes to drop his whole face in the bowl... then walk away dripping.

It wasn't doing this in hour one, I just noticed it now (hour 5 ish).\nI'm not sure if this is common for all of pet safe products, just this one, or if its just mine. :(\n\nSide note: its working fine and motor doesn't sound broken... just loud... which the instructions say would happen if pump is loose (its not), fountain is dirty (only on hour 5), and no other reason.

Cans (Case of 12)", "Flavor Name:": " Rabbit"}, "reviewerName": "Rae", "reviewText": "WARNING:  Contains VOLCANIC ASH, recognized carcinogen, heavy-metal-laced toxic material given GRAS status in 1977 for use in FOOD CONTAINERS ONLY, not allowed for human consumption.\n\nThis is the same review I have posted for the other verified purchases of this brand's products, applying to both the dog and cat food containing Volcanic Ash, also commonly called Montmorillonite and Bentonite Clay.\n\nI found this food brand on Dog Food Advisor, a site I love and trust, even today, and began using the Instinct Rabbit, Duck and Lamb for dogs and cats, the canned varieties, with my cat and dogs. We first used the food over a year ago, with health consequences we are still attempting to figure out. However, after a few months of dedicated, exclusive dietary use for our cat, she went into liver failure. The dogs became ill and are recovering after withdrawing the food. The cat's condition is difficult and, unfortunately, we don't know how that is going to play out but our vet is hopeful. Years ago, we had an incident with a different cat and a different food, garlic causing Heinz Anemia. We thought that was irresponsible, using garlic with dogs and cats when they are not human and cannot ingest the same chemicals. This makes that look like nothing. Montmorillonite Clay, also called Bentonite Clay and, most commonly, called Volcanic Ash, is a substance comprised of various minerals and toxic metals. The circulating folk wisdom is that this substance has an ionic charge that makes it impossible for the high levels of toxic metals and radioactive isotopes found within to leach from the ash into your system. Basic chemistry throws this out the window. What is worse, ionic charge is not the issue. Acid leaching is the issue. In the same way that acid in Orange Juice will leach lead from a leaded crystal goblet and that tomato sauce will leach lead and other metals from clay cookware and clay utensils, the human stomach, with a pH of around 3, will leach from Clay/Ash. A dog has a pH  of 1.5 to 2. A cat has a pH of 1. Again, this chemical soup is not allowed in human food, with our less acidic stomachs, because our less acidic stomachs will leach lead and aluminum and arsenic and mercury from this toxic substance. Our bodies, in response, will sweat metal, excrete metal in our waste, store metal in our fat, all in an attempt to rid ourselves of what we have ingested from a less acidic stomach leaching less of the heavy metals in this than our dogs and cats will leach.\n\nWhen we went to our Veterinarian and then to our Internal Medicine Specialist, they each had us discuss all possible issues, all supplements and foods, as we are very into holistic medicine. Both honed in on the same issue almost immediately. The Instinct brand of food uses Montmorillonite Clay (Bentonite Clay, Kaolin, Ash, what have you) and this is poison, simply and plainly, an active poison. This substance was last evaluated by the FDA in 1977. As stated earlier, it was declared to be GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) for use in packaging (in the cardboard itself, as a drying agent and in silica packets) but was not declared safe for use in food. In other words, it is not technically legal to use this in food. In 2016, the FDA warned a company that had started selling this clay for human ingestion to stop doing so and warned consumers that it is not safe, due, primarily, to lead contamination and the high likelihood of lead poisoning. No research was done into the effects of the clay, whether or not anyone got sick, and I have been informed that none will be, as the warning was given and the consumer has access to all the information they need in the GRAS database. Basically, the FDA leaves it up to you and me to look up this chemical and be smart enough not to ingest it. And, still, here it is, in cat and dog food.\n\nAsh or Clay is made up of Silica, Aluminum, Lead, Uranium, Mercury, Arsenic, etc. It contains radioactive isotopes, lending to the ionic charge that some people cite as the magic that will stop your body from absorbing these and other chemicals upon ingestion of this toxic substance.  There is a belief that the ionic charge of clay makes it safe, keeping the lead and aluminum from being absorbed by the body binding them. This is, forgive the expression, bunk. Ionic charge is unrelated to acid-leaching. In Mexico, during a tragic time when children were dying without explanation, it was discovered that clay cookware was poisoning them. Ionic charge did not stop leaching of metals into acidic foods and it will not stop this from leaching into your baby's body.\n\nThe worst part of the issue with this additive, not including what is happening in our family, is that we all have different tolerances and our bodies will react differently to this toxic substance. Some can ingest this for years before developing cancer or liver failure. Some, with weak livers or weak immune systems, will get sick immediately. Animals with sensitive livers will often turn up their noses at this food brand, from what I was told, because they learn the taste of metals, the substances that make them feel ill. The radioactive isotopes weaken the immune system, as does lead, as do many elements in the clay, such that cancer and immune reactivity syndromes can occur, along with unexplained illness and repeated infection. Liver failure is only one possible consequence of ingesting Volcanic Ash and it can occur months or years later, as exposure is cumulative. The way that the body purges itself of metals is complex and involves multiple organ systems, including the skin. Our bodies will even resort to storing metals in our fat cells when the metals can't be purged safely. We end up with metal deposits in the brain. In studies, Montmorillonite Clay was found to cross the blood-brain barrier and cause cell lysis (cell death) but, oddly, not in cancer cells, which don't seem to mind the substance one bit. Had our girl not had this reaction so early in our use of Instinct pet food, we could have poisoned all of our dogs right along with her, over the course of who knows how many months or years. Our vet said that \"idiopathic liver failure\" is often attributed to food additives years after animals have died, by owners who remember using a product that contained a substance the industry no longer uses. Most companies stopped using Ash after it was found to cause cancer and liver failure. Instinct changed the name and assumed that none of us would figure it out.\n\nThe FDA, notorious for allowing dangerous substances in food and cosmetics, does not allow Volcanic Ash, Montmorillonite Clay, Bentonite Clay, Kaolin, etc., in food, for the obvious toxic danger it poses, an issue we have known about for decades. If this substance is unsafe for human consumption, with our less efficient acid-leaching stomachs, then this substance is more unsafe for dogs and still less safe cats than even their beautiful siblings. Please understand, you shouldn't be giving this additive to any animal, ever. I rarely say, in the absolute, that you should never use a product. However, this entire pet food company should be off limits until they remove Ash/Clay from their products, remove, not rename.", "summary": "DEADLY", "unixReviewTime": 1505520000}

Within 24 hrs, she started pooping outside the box once or twice *a* *day*.  She was still using the box to pee, but It was almost as if she was specifically avoiding using the litter box for pooping.  Not good.

Beanie", "reviewText": "What makes this harness so much more unique than other harnesses is that it has both a front AND back clip. There are pros and cons to front and back clip harnesses.\n\nBack clip pros: better control if you need it, and safer than a collar. eg, jumps in front of a car, another dog lunges at him, etc.\nBack clip cons: re-enforces \"sled pulling\" activity (which is what you're probably trying to eliminate)\n\nFront clip pros: causes dog to turn toward you, but does create sled pulling action. Also more agreeable (in my opinion) to the dog than a gentle leader.\nFront clip cons: when the dog learns good leash behavior, he can trip over the leash since it's in front of him.\n\nThis harness is the best of both worlds! I used the front clip when I was leash training my dog to reduce the pulling reaction, but also encourage her to turn toward me when I needed it. Now that she is trained and can keep a good leash, I move the clip to the back where she won't trip on it. If she gets excited and needs some re-enforcement of her manners, I simply move the clip back to the front to remind her. My dog is also working on her leash reactivity and de-sensitizing to other dogs. When we go on training walks with other dogs, I choose to keep the leash in back. Even though it encourages pulling, I have found that if she lunges I can better control her. With the front clip on, she will trip and potentially get hurt if I have to pull her back for safety. (I should also note that she already had good leash manners and recall--ie, will look to me if I need her attention--before we started these walks with other dogs)\n\nMost harnesses force you to choose between the front and the back. Both the front and back clip serve different purposes so I was delighted to find on that had both and can fit my dog's training needs! I highly recommend getting this harness!", "summary": "Best of Both Worlds!", "unixReviewTime": 1464134400}

They need at LEAST 1 gallon, and 2.5 gallons and up is much better.\n- They shouldn't be with or near other bettas unless breeding.\n- They are carnivores and need carnivore fish food. They do not eat plants, and they shouldn't eat dried pellets, flakes or freeze-dried food, which bind them up.\n- They need heated water (75-80).\n- They need a clean tank just like every other fish.\n- A single betta with the correct supplies for living by itself will cost about $100.

It is all natural and I figure she can get some of her Omega 3s. I use it during our walks, when we practice commands in the backyard, and when I want her to go in her crate. I usually limit 5-6 pieces of either this or the Cadet Duck Breast Jerky per day.\n\nThe only human food that she gets as a treat s a sliver of apple of cucumber, salmon, a cooked egg, or a piece of cheese. This is occasional. She is a 50 pounds 5 year old Chow 25% , Boston Terrier 25% , and the rest Doggo Argento, Sharpei, Pit, Bull terrier mix. Yup her grandparents were hippies in the 60's so obviously they were very promiscuous :) She looks like a Lab/shepherd mix her DNA test picked these breeds. I rescued her 2.5 years ago.\n\nShe is a picky eater especially her wet food. Since the only meat I eat is salmon, I thought I would make that her main protein source. I did a bit research of research and found that wolves do eat salmon in Alaska; the bears catch the salmon and the wolves scavenge on what's left behind.\n\nI wanted to feed her really premium dog food. Dog food with Salmon as the first ingredient and not just meal and fillers. I chose Blue Buffalo Basics - Salmon and potato for her dried food + Blue Buffalo Basics - Salmon wet food.  I would take 1 cup of the dried food and add 6 ounces of the wet food. I tried adding broth. I tried adding 6 ounces of human pink salmon. She would take a bite here and there , She would eat the whole thing but it would take her hours. By then there would flies and ants all over her bowl. So finally after two years I decided to try a non-salmon wet food.\n\nI bought Paul Newsman's brand organic chicken formula which she kind of liked and then I discovered Trader Joe's Chicken Chunks that she loves. I use the same amount of 6 ounces of the wet food with her dried food. It's 1/2 of the price of other products, it has all natural ingredients, and she licks her bowl clean in 5 minutes flat. I am one happy Papa now!\n\nPlease note I don't over feed her so that she has a long healthy life. She is healthy, has a shiny coat, and is maintaining her 50 pound girlish figure.

She also knows how to open dog gates, sliding and bi-fold doors as well as the double latched door to her kennel.  She has also figured out how to unclip her harness so, even if I do find the perfect dog-proof car restraint, she can still free herself whenever she so desires.\n\nIn conclusion, this adapter is probably wonderful for small to mid sized dogs who are content with merely looking out of  car windows and lack the motivation or the necessary problem solving skills to figure out how to release themselves.", "summary": "The problem is my dog, not the adapter", "unixReviewTime": 1410048000}

Since Comfort Zone is intended to reduce anxiety I figured it wasn't a fair test.  The new cat, as it turned out, just has an aggressive personality, and my other cat wasn't really bothered by her aggression -- he's a mellow guy.\nNow, over 2-1/2 years later, mellow guy started spraying and peeing in inappropriate places.  New cat had upped her aggression in certain areas and a mutual game of ambush-at-the-litter-box had begun.  I'd guess this was an indication that mellow guy was stressed, but a combination of adding additional litter boxes in other rooms and using Comfort Zone didn't solve the problem (and yes, I had a veterinarian check him out).  I got mellow guy back to the litter box by placing a box with a \"cat attract\" litter in the same room where he was peeing inappropriately.  I almost didn't order the refill of Comfort Zone after the first 30 days but I decided to when it seemed that the aggression between the two cats was becoming more frequent and vicious.  Now I'm nearing the end of the refill and I'm not sure if I'll refill it again.  Other reviewers seem to have had better results.

When we first got them we installed some permeant metal gates on each side of the living room which divides the house so we can keep them either in the back of our home with access to the garden or in the kitchen. Its great but sometimes you need an extra temporary gate.\n\nWhen my husband does some DIY around the house in the bedroom or in the bathroom the pups get extremely sad if they are shut out by a solid door. This gate is a very nice temporary solution for blocking a doorway while letting our doggies watch from the other side.\n\nThis particular gate is nice because it is fairly light weight and not too high. Its high enough to deter 15  20lb pugs from trying to jump over while at the same time being low enough for my husband and I to step over it fairly easily. (I am 58 and my husband is 6.)\n\nThe gate is fairly typical of this style with a diagonal plastic mesh that your pets can see through . A pair of hinged bars one with a row of notches while the top bar locks into. You slide the two halves to change the width and the row of notches let you lock it at your chosen width. It works well though I felt the wood could have been finished a bit better. It is slightly rough when you slide your hand over it, but not rough enough that you will get a splinter or a knitted garment caught on it.\n\nThe one thing to remember when you put it up is to make sure the locking bars are on the opposite side to your pets. Not because they can open it, but we caught them gnawing on those locking bars because they are the only thing within easy reach and easy to sink teeth into.\n\nWhen installed in the doorway the pressure on the rubber stops on each side do hold firm without leaving marks on the door frame. When its not blocking a doorway we  lean it extended across a small bookshelf to protect the lower row of books having their spines chewed.\n\nAll in all we like the gate and it is reasonably priced.

I was hesitant to buy it because of the price. I thought that it may just be cheap shampoo in a fancy bottle. It turns out I was wrong and she was exactly right. You really can use less soap.\n\nMy dachshund has sensitive skin along with an allergy to fleas.  We use a Frontline type flea treatment but she still gets the occasional flea bite. The hot dry weather here was wonderful for producing a bumper crop of fleas. It also caused my poor little dog's skin to be extra dry. She was constantly scratching, even losing sleep because she'd wake up and have to scratch.\n\nWe used the Tropiclean shampoo today. We followed the instructions to the letter making sure we left the soap on for 5 to 10 minutes. Our Doxie does not like being wet so like always she fought us and tried to escape. Then a funny thing happened. She quit fighting and raised her head up in her \"Oh this feels so good.\" manner. She stood and let us wash her with no problem. Like the reviewer with the Yellow Lab said we used less soap than with other brands. My former brand was the Petco generic brand soap. As soon as i got it on my hands I could even feel the difference in quality. This soap had a thicker, richer, finer feel to it. It also had a good smell.\n\nThe Tropiclean had an immediate effect on my dog. It was three hours ago that I washed her and she has not scratched yet. In fact after we were done she had a lot of energy. Watching her frolic was well worth the money I paid for this shampoo. One last thing... Before the bath I could scratch her back and she would raise her back paw involuntarily and scratch like dogs do when you scratch just right. After the bath she quit doing that. Try as I might I could not get her to do that.  That proved to me the shampoo did it's job very well.\n\nWe have used oatmeal based shampoo before but the Tropiclean has a form of tea in it and apparently that boosts the effect of the oatmeal. Whatever is in it it is absolutely the best dog shampoo I have ever used. Just be sure and follow those instructions. I also found out that the company that sells this stuff is located not very far from where I live.

There have been a couple of times that the seat got taken off from the headrest and was just sitting on the seat of the car and he would get into anyway even though it was all flatten. The funniest time was when my spouse was putting the seat back up and the dog was trying to get into before they were done.  The straps still annoy me, and I don't even use the clip that attaches to his collar because that is just too annoying to deal with. But I can't argue with the dog's satisfaction, especially since it is for him!\n\n***Old Review***\nI didn't care for this seat.  It takes me too long to put the seat into the car and I find the clip hard to work and very cheap.  My dog is small, only 6 pounds, and I have a hard time getting the clip to attach to my dog's harness.  My dog is very patient and lets me fiddle around trying to get the clip hooked in.  I can't imagine trying to clip in a very antsy dog.  The front part of the seat doesn't stand up right even after I move around the straps. My dog can sit in it fine and it doesn't seem to bother him, but it drives me crazy that the front part of the seat won't stand up right.

So frustrating as it is almost good! We have this on our Doberman puppy who is 6 months.  He's a chewer.  This factors into my opinion of this product.  He's very squirmy, so it's hard to put on him but no star reductions for this, because as it turns out hard to put on also equals hard to take off!  He's destroyed 2 coats with velcro recently as it's very easy for him to grab the connecting pieces and yank them off.  Destruction is fun until you spend the next 5 hours cold while your puppy parents are at work!  This coat resolves one problem, huzzah!\n\nNow the reason I'm reducing two stars is because I consider the neck on this to be a design flaw.  It's got this loose, popped collar look to it.  Unfortunately, that means he can stick his head down, grab the neck with his mouth, and chew on the coat (it also means if he's drank a bunch of water and has a drippy face, some dribbles into the coat).\n\nWe try to keep it folded down, and out of chomping/dripping range, but over the course of the day it pops up, so the neck is mangled but the rest of the coat remains in good condition.\n\nThe coat also is dangerously close to his junk and gaps slightly. I worry one of these days he's going to get pee into his coat.  Would be nice for the fabric to taper up more on that part of the coat to accommodate for male dogs (or sell separate styles for male and female dogs).  We actually could have been using this coat on him a few weeks ago if not for that part, as when it arrived it actually completely covered his junk.\n\nThankfully he's growing fast and it seems like we may *fingers crossed* by in the clear with regards to that issue.  It's clear that this product is not long for this world due to his chewing, but I am thankful for it's zipper back style despite it taking two people to put it on.  I wouldn't use the rings on the back for a leash, the fabric doesn't feel tough enough for a hard pulling dog.\n\nPlease note- sizing is tough.  A 6 month old Doberman puppy (granted, he's large for his age) is wearing a 6L!\n\nHe's just past 50lbs, but it's necessary for that barrel chest.\n\n*UPDATE* no alterations to stars because it's not a product issue necessarily but may be helpful for other people with difficult dogs in need of coats- but the puppy figured out how to get it off and chew it up.  If you have a difficult dog like I do, this may give you a little more time before they destroy it, but won't ultimately save the day.  After he chewed the first one up, we got a second one, sprayed it with bitter spray where he chewed off the previous one- that bought us a couple days, but he did ultimately find a new way to chew it off.  I guess we should have doused the whole thing with bitter spray...", "summary": "Good parts, frustrating parts.", "unixReviewTime": 1456099200}

My Rott, who is much older, had a yeast infection (or similar) on his hind end that never really went away no matter what I tried. I read about corn allergies in dogs and decided to switch them to a higher end food in an attempt to help the skin issues.\n\nAnother review mentioned the high fat content of some of the lines of TOTW. Fat is vital to skin and hair health so I believe the higher amount of fat helped heal my dogs, however it's good to rotate the flavors used to get the benefits of each one.\n\nBenefits I experienced from TOTW:\n- Eliminated allergy dermatitis in one dog, and immune system? in the other, to eliminate skin issues\n- Promoted skin and coat health\n- Markedly improved arthritis (Springtime, Inc. supplements, purchased later, improved even more)\n- Easier to maintain weight (one dog tends to gain weight quickly... no they are not fed table scraps)\n- More cost efficient and the dogs eat less.

Not sure why they would do that, as this should be a completely sealed waterproof unit, as are all of my other aquarium power supplies, but perhaps they felt it would be easier to build a housing the breathes rather than one that is sealed? Also, the feet that hold the light on to the tank do not lock on to the top of a glass aquarium, so it's likely to fall in when you take the top off of your tank for cleaning. I used double sided tape to stick the feet to my tank.\n\nThose I could have lived with, except for 2 things - it generated so much radio frequency interference as to make my licensed radio station unusable when the light is on. But the worst part is that it worked for about an hour and then stopped. I turned it off and unplugged it to see if I could suppress the RF noise with a ferrite choke, and when I plugged it back in, it wouldn't turn on!\n\nNeedless to say, this is going back to Amazon.\n\nUpdate: I obtained a replacement, and somehow got it in the non-functional state again. I'm not sure exactly what fixed it, but some combination of mashing buttons got it working again. The second unit also generates a heck of a lot of RF noise.\n\nUpdate 2/2/16: I have been in contact with the manufacturer about the RF noise. They seem responsive, and concerned about the problem. I isolated the problem to the power supply, and found that their manufacturer intentionally left out an inductor that should have filtered the RF noise. I've added a star for the customer service received, and will update further if the issue is corrected.\n\nUpdate 3/7/16: The manufacturer sent me a new power supply with the inductor installed which has quieted the noise. That puts this light into the range of tolerable and even decent. With a few design improvements it could be a great light.", "summary": "Poor quality", "unixReviewTime": 1453161600}

This ball has deep, flexible texture, so he can grab a hold of it easily with his small mouth and then swim back to a pool step with it for more action.
