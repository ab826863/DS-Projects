Baker", "reviewText": "Apple to Apples is an extremely fun party game good for 4 or more people.\n\nThe set up is very easy.  The game comes with 756 red apple cards with name of a person, place, or thing on it.  There are 252 green apple cards which a characteristic of a person, place, or thing.\n\nIf you play with four people each person gets seven red apple cards.  You then draw a green apple card that the judge reads to the players and lays face down on the table.  The other players have to choose a red apple card that best matches the green apple card.  The judge picks the red apple card that is the best fit and the player that laid down that red apple card wins the green apple card.  If you are playing with four people the first person to win eight green apple cards wins the game.  (That number is reduced when there are more players).\n\nIt's even more fun because everybody gets to be a judge.  The role of judge passes to the next player going counterclockwise.\n\nThere are many reasons this game is very fun.\n\nFirst, you can get some very funny comparisons.  For example, let's say the green apple card is \"dainty\" - delicate, elegant, graceful.  Let's say you have several red apple cards but the only one you can come up with is \"hippopotamus.\"  The judge may find that such a funny opposite he or she may choose that card as the winner.\n\nSecond, you can't cheat.  The judge is the sole person who decides who wins the green apple card.  You can hide and not let the judge know what you played, or you can sit and lobby the judge to choose your card.  It's a wide open contest.  It does get a little annoying when someone always chooses their spouses card regardless, but it's not against the rules.  You can even play to the personality of the judge.\n\nThird, you can play with a lot of players and the more players you have, the more fun the game becomes because you get even more funny comparisons.\nAnd finally, the game is very fast moving and often after one game is over, people want to play it again.\n\nI highly recommend this game for an easy, fast paced party game.", "summary": "Very Fun Party Game", "unixReviewTime": 1227916800}

Based on her initial joyful reaction and the fact that she carries her around everywhere, I would rate this doll 5 stars. However, from an adult/ consumer perspective this Barbie doesn't feel as well made as other dolls. She's a little flimsy and lacking in quality and I would probably only rate her 2 stars. Therefore, I averaged her rating to 3.5 stars. The fact is she's a very pretty doll with a unique feature and she makes my little girl happy.", "summary": "3.5 stars", "unixReviewTime": 1397347200}

You select a \"dice challenge\" card with a dice combination on it and roll the dice as many times building in the dice holder until you get it right.  Speed is key!  If you win you gain possession of the \"Steven\" doll and the challenge card. After ten rounds the player with the most cards wins the game.  Great for kids learning addition, etc. and to keep their minds engaged.  Definitely a contender for family game night.

My nephew can play with pink or red or blue, it doesn't matter!\n\nMy only complaint is that the drawing board appears smaller then the picture.

When it push it one way it goes down, then you can push it again and move it back up.  It's pretty cool.  The mini-figures are great.  Captain Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swan are both two faced.  One side of Captain Jack Sparrow's is human and the other is skeleton.  That's awesome.  Elizabeth has a calm face and an angry face.

The players work together to solve the mystery; everyone wins, or everyone loses.\n\nEvery turn players have the choice to: search a room, talk to an animal, or feed an animal.  You have to find the food that the animal wants before you can feed it, and generally, when you feed the animal, it gives you useful information in exchange.  Some of the rooms allow you to interact with items such as an anvil, a magic well, etc.\n\nHere is the Dr. Games evaluation:\n\nGO/NO GO criterion\n\n* Complexity: Whoowasit scores well on this one!  The game plays at three levels of complexity.  It defaults to the Easy setting.  The Easy setting definitely is appropriate for the 7-10 year old crowd, and the Hard setting was difficult even for a set of 30 somethings that I played it with!  You have a limited number of choices each turn, and the game actually helps you keep track of what you have done and gives verbal hints on the lower complexity settings.\n\n* Balanced: The game is emminently balanced, because it is a cooperative game.  All the players win or lose together.  If the players work together and have a general plan then they will win.  If the players do not cooperate or make random moves then they will lose.  It could not be more balanced.\n\n* Chance: The game has the appropriate level of chance for its theme.  The game is randomized each time you play, but there is not a lot of chance during the play.  Once the puzzle and the clues are set, they are set.  Revisiting a room and doing the same action nets you the same result each time.\n\n* Clarity: The game does fine in this area, but if I had one constructive criticism then it would be that not everything was obvious in the rules.  For example, my groups were not sure when you needed keys just to open the trunks or whether you needed the keys to open the doors too.  In some cases, e.g., the Tower, the game would not allow you in until you had done something else.\n\n* Reasonable Time: Once you know the rules, you can play a game from start to finish with four players in less than 30 minutes.  Yes, it was concluded in a very reasonable time.\n\nBONUS criterion\n\n* Social: Because it is a cooperative game, there is plenty of opportunity for positive interactions with the other players.\n\n* Unique/interesting Mechanic: The magic box with talking animals is a very cool and novel approach to the mystery game genre.  Bravo!\n\n* Inform: The game does teach you about logic, how to deduce and how to search in a structured way.\n\n* Rewards Throughout: little victories within the game is a better approach than all or nothing at the end, and Whoowasit delivers both big nd little rewards throughout the game.\n\nAs a bonus, I could imagine a youngster playing the game by his or herself.  While you can play with up to four, with slight modifications, you could play this game solo.\n\nI highly recommend adding this game to your family bookshelf.\n\nIn service,\n\nRich\n[...]", "summary": "Excellent educational game!", "unixReviewTime": 1313020800}

Cohen", "reviewText": "Its a great system, but I have 2 basic problems with it, one much more important here than the other.  The less important issue is that its a small system.  This is less important because I knew about that and I knew the system is expandable.  So, the more important issue: when the item arrived, it was in damaged condition.  I knew I wasn't giving it to my son for a while (I bought it for his birthday), so I opened the box to check how bad it was.  None of the wooden pieces were connected (as they should have been) to the cardboard.  One of the marbles in the bag was actually cracked in 2!.  In general, I opened the box to find a mess.  But I cleaned up that mess, attaching the wooden pieces to the cardboard (the ties were there), tossed the broken (and yes, sharp!) marble, and generally made it look good.  Today, we actually gave it to our son.  We went to set up one of the configurations and I discovered one of the wooden pieces is actually broken (with an inch wide piece of 1 or 2 layers of the wood broken off).  This is really unfortunate.  It seems like a great product, but either we were shipped a box that had a set someone else messed up OR the shipping of the product--either to us or somewhere else in the supply chain--was really bad.  Still, it works well and my son seems to love it (I don't think he realizes there is a broken piece).\n\nAdded: I no longer think the set was used.  I now just think the wood pieces are poorly constructed.  It may be that the wood used is bad, that the glue holding the wood layers together is bad, or some combination, but whatever it is the wooden \"tracks\" break off.  This is a real shame.  We thought we were buying a product that would be far better than the plastic marble racer sets--I even foolishly thought it would be something my son would be able to pass on to his children (when he is older I will give him my old erector set!).  And I thought we would be adding pieces to it, little by little, so that he would build cooler and cooler systems.  Alas, while this looks like that sort of product, its not.  Wooden toys always look good, but if you use crap material, you get a crap product, whether its plastic or wood.  Its still fun and educational, but I can't recommend it.  In a nutshell, you might as well buy a plastic set if its cheaper.  This won't last longer and you won't want to add pieces.", "summary": "Great toy, but received w/broken pieces!

There are hundreds of key combinations, none of which are easy to remember. (I think there was one called A.A.A that did something fun.)\n\nIt is missing some of the key features that most robots have these days. It has no mode that will let it run on its own. It cannot sense the edge of a table and of course will break if it falls. It cannot sense something in front of it. It only has sensors that keep it from falling over, although with feet nearly as long as it's legs are tall, It does not need sensors that much. It has a small vocabulary of words it understands and it does pretty well with that if in a quiet room. It's own voice is not very loud which is a good thing as it is quite chatty. There is a program mode which is a bother to use.\n\nIf you are looking for a robot toy with a bit more \"robotics\" in it, the Robosapian and other Wowee robot toys are a much better bet. If you want to teach your older child (12+) about real robotics the Vex kit is the way to go.\n\nIf you are looking for something to ENTERTAIN a 8-13 year old that is VERY careful with toys or an adult that needs another bit of technology on his desk, this would be just the thing.\n\nPS.

In the package, you get Teresa dressed in a removable helmet, painted on riding pants, a floral shirt and denim vest (removable), and cowgirl boots, the horse with movable legs, and a small plastic brush for the horse. No assembly is required, though you will need 4 AAA batteries that are NOT included. The battery compartment is located under the horse's stomach. Teresa measures about 12\" tall and the horse measures about 11\" x 11 1/2\" and was larger than I expected. The details on the horse are beautiful, including the painted on purple saddle, the blue eyes, and the etched detailing on the horse's mane.\n\nTo operate the horse, hold Teresa horizontally over the horse and insert the pink piece in her hand into the ribbon hole on the side of the horse until you hear a click, then rotate Teresa towards you and down to stand up and you'll hear another click of the ribbon. At first I was nervous about bending the ribbon outward, but it seems well made and functions properly. Once Teresa is in position, you can press either the button on the horse's forehead and he'll start to walk, she jumps on, and rides! Or you can press the button on the side mane once she's in standing position and she will jump on first, then the horse walks as she rides.\n\nMy daughter takes horseback riding lessons and she gets so excited over this doll because she rides just like her. Everything seems well made - she's knocked it over on the kitchen floor several times and it still works perfectly fine. The only negative about Teresa is that due to the nature of how her legs have to split to jump on the horse, you can't really use her as a regular Barbie because she can't sit down or stand up straight (one leg is longer than the other). As far as the horse is concerned, the mechanics of it do make a loud noise when in operation and it doesn't work on carpeted floors because the legs get stuck on the carpet fibers as it walks and ends up tipping over. It will operate on tables, hard wood, and tiled floors.\n\nOverall this is a super fun toy that any horse loving girl would enjoy! It's really cool to watch her jump on by herself and has given my daughter lots of hours of enjoyment!", "summary": "Super Fun Toy Any Horseloving Girl Will Enjoy!", "unixReviewTime": 1453852800}

We love it!  I wasn't sure if my boys - ages 6 and 8 - would be able to manage it, but they are figuring it out and having a great time.  We started by playing with our cards open on the table and coaching everyone together, so we all learned how to play at the same time.  Now that the boys have sorted out how it plays, they are able to go on their own, and have even developed their own strategies.  It fits great with two Thomas loving boys.\n\nPlay moves along quite smoothly, with each player trying to build train lines that connect up specific city to city routes as designated by destination tickets.  Routes are claimed by collecting series of colour train car cards that allow the player to place their plastic train cars onto the board.  The only point that we found a bit confusing is that there are five colours of train cars - each player gets a colour, but there are also coloured routes that while they match player colours actually have nothing to do with these colours.  A bit confusing at first, but after a few rounds you quickly forget and it all makes sense.\n\nIf you want to get a feel for how it plays, I recommend the mobile App version of the game.  We purchased it shortly after the board game, and every member of the family loves it, and uses it to hone their game when on the go.  We took the board game to the grandparent's house last weekend, and we had 2 kids, 1 parent and 2 grandparents all playing together, with the kids showing the grandparents how to play.  Playing with 5 players added a new level of strategy to it for sure!\n\nA fun game for all, but a bit addictive .. beware!

Personally, I love the fact that the storage tub is a taller, slimmer size. It makes storing it away in a corner of the room even easier. It takes up less space overall. The lid just lays on top, in place, and does not snap or lock, but that's ok with me. Less chance of little pinched fingers and it's easier for a child to open and close themselves.  There's no specific handles on it either, but there is a nice \"lip\" sort of handle on each side. It's plenty adequate enough for carrying or lifting it.\n\nThus set comes with decals to put on some of the blocks, as well as a vehicle base with 4 wheels, a little boy figurine and a cute little dog. The boy and the dog both attach to the blocks. There's also cards to show you how to build a few items, like alligator and dinosaur, robot, etc.\n\nOverall it's a nice set whether you're just starting out or adding to your blocks. The tub for storage is an obvious bonus and the neat size and shape of the tub is appealing as well.\n\nThe ONLY downfall to these blocks is... no more rounded corners like the larger blocks have and having to control your potty mouth when you step on one unexpectedly.

The toy has three settings:  first stage, second stage, and third. The first stage, as you would expect, is more simple. So when you press the carrot, the toy says \"orange.\" In the second stage, the ideas get a little more complicated. So if you press the strawberry, and it says \"Strawberries are my favorite fruit.\" In the third stage, you start getting longer phrases and songs, even jokes. For example, when you press the broccoli, it says, \"Hey broccoli. How's it growin'? Haha.\" My son likes all three stages, honestly, so he ends up getting a lot of variety. He especially likes the songs, and I kind of wish the toy offered more in that area--though I'm still really happy with the content and sound quality of what is available.\n\nThe one meh thing about the toy is the watering can. I notice my son doesn't play with it much. The crazy thing is that it does actually sound like water when you turn it upside down. It just isn't that fun, unfortunately.\n\nAs far as what parts come off and how the toy works, the watering can is separate, but it can hook onto the side of the yellow caddy. The three fruits/veggies (strawberry, carrot, and broccoli) can come out of the caddy completely. When you push them into the caddy, they will talk to you. The flowers don't come out, but you can push them and they will talk to you, too. Also, my toy DID NOT come with batteries (even though the product description says they are included), so make sure you have two AAs handy, just in case.\n\nOverall, though, this is a fun toy. Fisher Price says it's best for kids 9 mos to 3 years, but I think 3 years is pushing it.

It took about 30 minutes to read and comprhend the rules, and complete our first game.  The gist is that you are given tiles on a large grid and you create little pathways with the tiles you randomly draw.  The tiles then lead reward pieces back to the 'home base' that you share with another player (though you are on opposing teams).  When a reward jewel is able to travel a complete path to your base, both base owners earn a point.  That's it.\n\nThat said, there is a fair level of strategy, especially after a dozen pieces or so have been played.  The path can wind from one area to another in moments.  The rules are simple, the pieces are sturdy and beautifully decorated and the playtime is fast and fun.  My only knocks are that the rules could be a little more complete; to offer solutions to possible problem scenarios, but they are not half-baked.  We only ran into one odd play choice and we were able to come to a group decision on how to handle the outcome.  I would have liked to see higher scoring possibilites, maybe additional scoring gems or multipliers or something.  One of the pieces is worth 3 points, while all of the others were worth 1 or 2 points.  In every single game we played, whoever won the 3-point piece ended up as the overall winner.\n\nI would easily recommend Indigo to casual and 'hardcore' gamers a like, and for ages 6 and up.

I was at first skeptical of camouflage outfits but once I opened the box I was impressed. The camo looks COOL. And I think the shape of the Episode III helmets gives the clone less of a cartoony and more of a serious presentation (I actually have come to like the Ep 2 helmet when viewed alone, but the Ep 3 helmet is superior when they are compared). I also like the swamp hovercraft that is the mini-build of this set. It includes a couple of the stud basters which, in spite of their large size, are awesome because they work very, very well.\n\nThe downside of this set to me is the strange shape of the Scout Helmet. Instead of altering the Biker Scout Helmet from ROTJ, the visor section is wider and has a blue color. I have nothing against the color but the shape makes me think that all the Scouts are bug-eyed or have exceedingly large foreheads. My gripe boils down to the decision not to alter the same, old clone head to include a blue or black headband (like all the Batman mini-fig heads have a white headband to give Batman white eyes), a blue or black head covering (like the Tie pilots), or just black hair. These options would have prevented the shape of the head from being compromised.\n\nIn spite of this the two clones with the Ep 3 helmets went on a tropical vacation with us (too bad for them...so did the Rancor).", "summary": "Almost Nailed It", "unixReviewTime": 1423872000}

My six-year-old son and I had a lot of fun driving it around the neighborhood, doing off-road, jumping makeshift ramps, scaring the neighborhood cats, etc. It's a simple control vehicle -- not the finest controls in the world, but it's all responsive and works -- and it has a good range. The battery pack, once its fully charged, seems to last a decent length of time, too. The booklet said a full charge should last about 15 minutes, but that must be 15 minutes of continuous wheel turning; we clocked in a good 30 minutes of normal driving one time, and it still had some juice left.\n\nMy complaints about this are mainly technical. Specifically, the battery back, which is removable only by unscrewing a plate and then trying to unplug a very tight plug connector. It's unnecessarily difficult, especially for a child, to have to do this after each use (which is more or less how often you'll want to charge it, after each full play session). I've had other RC cars that charge right in the vehicle -- you just plug into the side. Why didn't Tonka go this route?", "summary": "Fun, but some poor design choices", "unixReviewTime": 1284595200}

I am very pleased with this soroban. Not too small in size and has 17 digits with the \"ones\" markings starting on the 3rd rod from the right, so first 2 can be used for decimal numbers. Perfect! I like the single color of beads as they are less distracting than colorful ones out there, though others may not agree. As described, it is plastic and lightweight which I like (portable) -- but because of this, other beads move easily when moving a bead or if frame is shaken. This might be a dealbreaker for most, BUT I knew this beforehand and knew to place soroban on cloth like a fabric placemat or kitchen towel while being used. Problem solved. I was thinking of getting one with a \"reset\" button, but after watching videos above, I saw how much easier it is to reset it by hand -- plus I won't have to deal with the possibility of malfunction of reset mechanism. (To reset - tilt soroban towards you so all beads slide down, then lie soroban flat on surface and slide thumb and forefinger along the beam from right to left so \"heaven\" beads move up.) To top it all, I got this product at a great discount from snagshout in exchange for this honest review. Hope to get some more. This is an ancient but amazing tool that everyone should go back to!\n\nUpdate 9/8/15: Kids and adult have no problem using this using pointers above, however the relatively small beads may prove a challenge to younger kids or those with \"chunky\" fingers. We bought a chunkier for little one so far but will advance to this as soon as able to. Definitely buying at least one more of these though, one for me too!

Each card has a different dog and when you choose him he goes on a \"mission\" with varied activities.

It stands on it's own very well, and looks great on the included stand.  The 36\" size is impressive, but it's not as gigantic as some other 36\" size models because there's not a lot of \"bulk.\"  What I mean is that it's a lean, mean, 36\" long...not some big, bulky, giant thing.\n\nThe thing I like most about the kit is that it gives you a good base to start customizing with paint for other looks and effects.  For instance, I've used quite a bit of black acrylic paint to both bring out details AND to essentially \"degloss\" the plastic pieces.  I feel that after adding the paint the skeleton is much more realistic looking, and it also looks more finished.  This is something that even a beginning hobbyist could accomplish, as the acrylic paint is easy to clean off if you end up doing something that you don't really want to do.\n\nOverall, I'm really happy having this model in my collection.

I paid for the unit as a gift for my son, who is not into cars but really loves this set so far.  He's configured different tracks and has easily adapted to learning how to use it.  I find a couple of things puzzling, such as the ratio of car size to track, the need to have on a complete flat surface, and times where the AI just quits for a split second causing the car to drive erratically.  The biggest issue, as noted above, is a 'Connection lost' issue after about 1 hour of run time.  I replace the car's AAA batteries and issue is eradicated, but intervals are too short.  I used the removed batteries in other products which seem to work fine.  The company states rechargeable work great but I can't see how these can retain power any longer than alkaline, which means the connection will definitely cease in even shorter intervals.  Not sure why other users haven't complained here (although I saw a couple in their forums).  Overall, I think it's a nice concept but am concerned the 'addictive' reviewers here haven't waited long enough to let that wear.

I definitely supervise her while using this ball. It comes deflated so you will have to pump it up which is easy and quick. They provide you a foot pump with hose as well as an english manual. This manual also has different ways you can use this ball which is awesome. It is very well made and durable. The handle is nice and sturdy for your little one to grasp onto. The top of the ball is nice and smooth and the bottom half has some texture to create some traction. Even though my toddler cannot reach the floor with her feet quite yet she still loves to play with it. She is able to bounce it around like a bouncy ball, you can get a good bounce out of it even though the handle gets in the way sometimes. She also practices her kicks with this ball or roll on it. Love the versatility of it and interesting ways to use it listed in the manual. Great product that will grow with your kid.

The Monster High line is the exception. The pieces are so visually appealing, wonderfully designed and executed for a mass-market toy, that I can't resist collecting just a few for my own enjoyment. When I saw the new large size, at such an affordable price --practically the same as the smaller versions!-- I didn't even work hard to justify the \"where the heck will I put it\" factor, and just ordered the Draculaura.\n\nAnd she is pretty great. The same grace as the small ones is there, same delicate hands and cute face, same fun fashion, and a nice new elbow and knee articulation style. But to achieve such a low price point, it seems they chose to make some sacrifices that might annoy a collector, though maybe not a child. There are rough spots on the feet and some edges that catch on the clothing, and relief-printed tiny numbers on the arms. The knee and elbow joints are just SLIGHTLY a different pink than the rest of the skin. The whole body is very light and hollow-feeling, and I wonder if it will break easily. The bangs, as others have mentioned, are shellacked and unbrushable. Also, the attention paid to the smaller dolls' clothing didn't translate up to the larger. With more canvas to play with, there is so much opportunity for fine detail that was just ignored, even the velcro fastening is unneccesarily thick and heavy. (Though all the seams are very tidy and the necklace is quite nice.) The shoes on the large Draculaura are especially clunky and made of a thick stiff rubber. Nothing like the shoes of the smaller dolls, with all their crazy sculpted details!\n\nI'm hoping that this size does well enough in retail to warrant improvements in the next wave. Maybe they were just in a rush to get these out before Christmas? The one thing that bothers me and probably won't ever be fixed, is the torso sculpt that they've chosen-- it gives the doll an intensely swayed back. Yes, all the little ones have it too, but for some reason, it's exaggerated in this size, so much that she looks hunchbacked if she's standing without totally sticking out her little belly.\n\nBut all those things are rather minor irritations to me, and I still am very happy with my purchase, and tickled pink to see her sitting languidly on my shelf. I think this size could be a real break-through in fashion dolls; most of the larger non-baby dolls are the American Girl type (with the great outfits/accessories/stories, but the boring/ugly faces). There could be some really beautiful clothing and accessories made for these larger ladies, if Mattel will just give them a bit more of a fighting chance...", "summary": "Does size matter?", "unixReviewTime": 1449532800}

So we got Monopoly Jr., and it's definitely easier for kids...perhaps *too* easy for some kids that are 7 or older.\n\nThe Monopoly Jr. board is rectangular, with less spaces than the adult version. Set in an amusement park, there are also Rail Roads, but they're just Roll Again spaces. The \"properties\" are amusement rides, arcades, or attractions which cost between $1-$4 for a ticket booth. When you land on a space, you MUST buy a ticket booth. Players have an opportunity to \"kick out\" other players if the property is split, but not if there's a 'monopoly'. There are some Chance cards, but they function in the same way: direct the player to a particular square where he may buy a ticket booth.\n\nAs with regular Monopoly, if you land on a space occupied by another player, you have to pay the player the fee. Otherwise, you must BUY the ticket booth.\n\nThere are four colored plastic game tokens: a yellow carousel horse, a green \"log jammer\", a blue bumper car, and a red roller coaster car.\n\nThere could be more variety to this game without making it too hard, so in my opinion, the game is a bit too simplistic. However, it's a nice way for the parents to spend time with the younger kids. My son seems to like playing the game, although he hasn't asked, specifically, to play it until Christmas.", "summary": "Nice Game for Younger Children", "unixReviewTime": 1168214400}

So why did the same company put out dice masters?  isn't it the same thing?  Not quite.  They are similar, but there are a few differences to take into consideration before you decide.\n\nFIRST-- Dice Masters is a 2 player only game, where Quarriors hosts up to 4 players per game.  Depending on your game group, one of these might be easier to get to the table than the other.  If there are 4 people, usually they will want to all play a game together...plus, if you don't have other 2 player games available you don't want to make people sit out and watch.  If you have a larger group, though, this can be a great filler for 2 people to play while they wait for others to show up or to finish another game.  TRUE- Quarriors can play with only 2 people...and it IS still fun that way... it just doesn't shine with only 2.\n\nSECOND-- The theme.  This may, or may not, have an influence on your fun.  You can answer that question yourself.  Dice Masters is dripping with the Marvel theme (well, this version.  there are also others coming) while Quarriors has its own theme of magic users summoning creatures.  This is aesthetics, but could make a difference on your playgroup.\n\nTHIRD-- The style of play.  There are some differences between the two (Dice Masters allows for a Yahtzee style of re-rolling every time...while Quarriors only allows a re-roll if a certain dice side allows for it to happen.  Although it sounds odd...in play form I prefer the Quarriors mechanic for re-rolls).  There are other differences including (but not limited to) the ability to have cards that other people can not use (Dice Masters) and multiple  options of how/where/when to play dice (Quarriors with Expansions) and even what the objective is (Dice Masters=kill opponent...Quarriors=gain victory points).  BUT THE REAL DIFFERENCE IN PLAY is that Quarriors feels like a \"boardgame\" where people are all sitting around playing a game and that is it....and Dice Masters feels like a \"tournament\" style game where you are forming your \"deck\" and going head to head with an opponent.  Both of them are good styles of play...it just depends on which one you are looking for from this game.\n\nLASTLY-- The cost involved.  Quarriors base game is more expensive, BUT it is ready to play right out of the box...and it will give you MANY hours and games of fun.  Dice Masters is cheaper and CAN be played right out of the box...but it is an extremely watered down version of the game that you won't want to play more than once or twice before knowing that you NEED more cards and dice.  Quarriors expansions tell you what you are getting (if you want more card variety, get Quarmageddon.  If you want new ways to score points get Quartifacts. etc..) so you can choose what you want, pay for it, and play it....slightly expensive, but you are getting the complete set for that expansion AND getting hours and hours of new game out of it.  Dice Masters is a \"collectible\" game...which means in order to get new characters you must buy random packs (2 cards and 2 dice per pack) in order to expand your playability and HOPE that you aren't getting cards you already have or dice you don't need.  At about $1 per pack at your local game store, the packs are cheap and it can be fun to have the excitement of opening something up and seeing what you have received....but it will likely take you A LOT of money to get enough characters and dice to have a selection that will provide you with enough variety for hours of play.\n\nIN THE END-- Quarriors and Dice Masters are both great games.  Decide which one makes sense for you and your group based on player count, theme, and style of play.  Then make sure you are willing to spend the money for it-- Quarriors=higher base game cost...but more hours of play from the base game....Dice Masters= expensive to get to the level of Quarriors, but still having fun getting it there counts for something too.\n\nGood Luck, and Choose Wisely!  :)", "summary": "Quarriors  OR  Dice Masters?", "unixReviewTime": 1418169600}

In this game you continually redeploy and conquer (no dice battles) until your numbers run short. Then you put your race in decline and pick a new one. Sounds simple, but the twist is that each race has a built in power and an additional special power that's randomly paired with it at the game's start. Additionally you can choose from the \"next\" race or pay to get one deeper down the line. With all the races and abilities this game is different every time so tons of replay. While the characters and themes could have really been anything, the ones they chose are really fun and well illustrated. Days of Wonder does a fantastic job with artwork and presentation on all their games. I also like that they give you different boards depending on the amount of players you have, instead of just saying \"dont use those spaces.\" It's just a lot nicer to be on the board you're \"supposed\" to be on. Small World is a simple game to learn and you'll be playing your first game within 20 minutes of starting the instructions, but it's also a LOT of fun with very little randomness and a lot of strategy.

As such, I will probably just leave the batteries out.\n\nWhat I really like is the updated look of the people and animals. They are realistic with real arms and/or legs. This is an improvement over the old ones because they are basically shapeless with a head.\n\nAnother nice improvement to this over the old farm is that the silo attaches and it closes.

Cards and answers can be as nasty as your group, which means you can play with your close, close friends, but you can also play an inter-generational game with your 18+ kids and the grandparents (as long as they aren't TOO conservative\").\n\nGameplay:  Great flow, lots of fun.  Basic idea is that there is a rotating reader, who reads a card.  The cards are something like: \"Things that are good about dating an older man.\" or \"Things that are kinky\" or \"Things that make a woman scream YES!\" or \"Things a proctologist might nickname his finger\".  Each person writes a response on the included paper strips.  The reader will read them all aloud, and then each person guesses, trying to match one of the responses with the person who wrote it.  If you are matched, the person guessing gets a point, and you are out.  If you are the last one standing who hasn't been guessed, you get two points.  Rinse and repeat, with the reader position rotating to the next person.  btw, we tried playing with 3 at first - definitely more fun with a greater number of players.\n\nI will offer a small gameplay variation - every time someone guesses your response, instead of a point, you take a shot.  If you're playing with the grandparents, just make sure it is a small shot!\n\nNice that there are 8 sharpened pencils in the box so you don't have to worry about finding writing supplies!  I like also the fact that with these cards, you can play them again unlike some other games where once you make it through the set of cards, you're done - this game can be different every time, even if you run across the same cards.\n\nThe one thing I didn't really care for is the instructions, where they are obviously trying a bit too hard to be irreverent and funny.  But that doesn't impact game play at all.  For example, they say \"We really don't wanna hear your comments about this game, but we know you're gonna bitch about something, so go ahead...\" - you get the idea.  There are also some minor gameplay issues when playing with larger groups - it is very difficult to remember who is out and who is still in, so using a marker or card isn't a bad idea.\n\nI was given a copy of this game to review, opinions and experiences are my own.", "summary": "If you liked Cards Against Humanity, you'll like this one...", "unixReviewTime": 1441411200}

What comes in the box is pretty straightforward - a large black game board, lots of colored blocks (apparently 320), and a fairly detailed instruction booklet.  What brings this all to life, of course, is the Bloxels app, which we were able to download on both an iPhone and an iPad.  The app itself takes a little exploration to fully grasp, even for an adult, and it would probably be best for an adult and child to work together on the first couple of projects to get the hang of Bloxels.\n\nMy daughter did get a little frustrated because we had to do a specific block pattern initially in order to unlock the app features, but once we got through that, everything is pretty much at your fingertips.  You can follow the booklet instructions and create game scenes and unique characters.  And using the app you can register and join the Bloxels community and see a wide variety of user-created projects.  For game scenes, it all comes down to understanding what the different colors represent, such as blue equals water, white equals story, and green equals ground.  The booklet has all of this information, but I really had to help my daughter out to get her started on this.  Beyond that, there's the camera issue.  Game board information (blocks and colors) get transferred to the app via the iPhone or iPad camera.  This takes a lot of patience, and I can easily see where this might frustrate some kiddos.  Light glare is often misread as white (story) blocks, and if you move the camera slightly before the app fully gets the game board configuration, you can end up with some very odd results.  But you can read the board with the camera as many times as necessary to get it right.  When we finally created a character, it took about five tries to get it to appear correctly on the app (and even then, a couple of colors were off).  But we really had a blast making subtle adjustments to allow the character to walk and jump, and it really looked great on screen when we finally got it inside the game.  My daughter was extremely proud of her accomplishments, and that's what this was all about -- the payoff from concentration and hard work.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend Bloxels as an engaging activity that offers fun and creativity yet demands patience and concentration.  Like any truly great game or activity, the more effort you put into it, the better your results will be.  Children can surely benefit from projects like this, and I know that my daughter and I will continue to use Bloxels as a fun and educational activity.", "summary": "Fun and creativity meets concentration and patience", "unixReviewTime": 1475971200}

Fans of the show know that Squidward is an ill-tempered and unlikeable lout, while SpongeBob and Patrick are bumbling, naive, and cheerful compadres. The story here is that Spongebob is testing his new jellyfish launcher and accidentally blows up Squidward's wall while he's taking a shower, paving the way for comic mischief.\n\nIn terms of build-quality and materials, this is a superb building set. Like all of Mega Bloks' sets, the pieces are well made and instructions finely detailed as full color drawings. Mega Bloks definitely does not skimp on the printing, and for this set, it comes with two instructions books. One person can build SpongeBob's pineapple while another can do Squidward's Moai. The sets are shown at an angle for maximum clarity and plenty of markings on the illustrations are shown to guide you along step by step. The tops of adjacent pieces are even color coded to make things easier to see. The level of detail is on par or better than Lego sets I've built in the past. If you lose them, Mega Bloks has the instructions on their site as PDF. 498 is a whole lot of pieces, so younger children may need adult assistance.\n\nMega Bloks seems to love making things launch in the SpongeBob line.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mega-Bloks-SpongeBob-Krusty-Krab-Attack/dp/B00J05MDOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mega Bloks SpongeBob Krusty Krab Attack</a>&nbsp;also has a patty flipper and other shootable parts.

Cook", "reviewText": "I really like this game.  It is unlike any other game I have ever played.  It requires more interaction and collective strategy than most other cooperative games.  It has six different scenarios which are really very different games, so it has a lot of replayability.  Because of the high level of interaction required to win, this game will be enjoyed most by people who know each other well and have good teamwork skills.  An overbearing player could really make this one a drag.\n\nThe rulebook is not very well written, which can make the game a challenge to learn.  I recommend the Castways Quick Start Guide to Robinson Crusoe, which is available from the Z-Man Games website.  Once you learn the rules, the game goes smoothly.  Plan on having three hours or so of free time.  This game is great for a cold winter day.\n\nThe game is hard to win, but alternative rules can make it easier.  Add Friday or a companion dog to your party of castaways and you will have an easier time the first few times you play.  I also like the fact that there are male and female versions of each of the main characters.  This is a minor thing, but male bias in game characters really annoys the heck out of my wife.\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge with this game is finding it.  There is a lot of interest in this game but not a lot of copies.

They had so much fun that I was able to visit with my mom without one interruption! I saw my son with it on his head and his sister watching intensely to see if he could make it. They laughed over and over as they tried to bounce the ball off different objects in grandma's house. The ball is so lightweight I wasn't even worried about them breaking anything. When it was time to go they put everything in the container and off we went. At home with all his friends and brother (10) it was the same thing.....kids cracking up as they tried all kinds of combinations. It's cool because they can use the cards for ideas or just do their own thing. My middle son is very into science so he tries to make a perfect set up. The oldest is wild and just goes for it. They love to challenge each other for some healthy brotherly competition. They even involve their sister and use her toys to bounce off.

It's adjustable.  He could start with his crib mattress, and when he outgrows that we can change him to a twin size.  This should make this bed last for years while he grows up.  Who knows maybe 9-10 and this will still be functional.\n\n2.) How much cooler can it be?  He loves the lights in the front.  We read his books to him in front of the car each night before he goes to bed.\n\n3.)  It's super durable since it's the hard Step2 plastic throughout.\n\nIt's a bed first and foremost, so it does what it's intended to do. I am sure any kid would love it, and of course dad does too.\nIt really looks cool in the middle of his room.  I expect it to last a long time, and may even have resale value when the time comes for him to move onto a real bed.\n\nThe only bad part about this was the packaging of the stickers that need to go on.  They were just thrown in the box in a bag, and had gotten all wrinkled and unusable.  A quick call however to Step2 customer support and they sent out a new batch right away.  Small inconvenience but the company took care of me.\n\nPrice is higher then the little tikes beds, but this is much bigger and definitely looks MUCH nicer.

The premium version is alot more realistic and detailed than the original version with all the great features. The advanced automorph technology triggers electronic lights and sounds around the chest,eyes,and shoulder decor. I know most people prefer the Megatron of G1 in his handgun form,but this is an awesome figure that if you are a Megatron fan you must consider. Megatron comes with a Rocket Claw that becomes a Chain Whip on one arm which he uses to do some damage in his escape from section 7 in the movie. Another cool feature is that his arms combine to form a Fusion Cannon just like he did in the movie as well. The detail from top to bottom is some of the best around and really gives Megatron a more realistic look. His vehicle mode is a cybertron jet mode which is very sweet looking once you get him to his vehicle mode. The poseability for battles with Optimus or other autobots is simply the best. The transformation level is super conversion or advanced meaning if you have plenty of experience with transformers there is still a challenging difficulty. If you are a parent buying for a child of 5-6 or younger you will have to help some in the process. Megatron is on awesome transformer,but he can be very challenging for a younger age group. The trickiest part of the transformation is getting Megatron's legs positioned just right in vechicle mode. This part can take some practice and patience. The durability of Megatron is outstanding to say the least. He can take whatever comes his way and then some. Bottom line Megatron Premium Leader is a high quality,well-made,10 out of 10 figure that all transformer fans should enjoy.

Yes, it does require a little muscle to put together, but it stays together! We bought this castle used when my son was 18mo.  Now he is 13...  That's over 10 years!\n\nThe castle has been used outside in rough Colorado weather, set up inside our house and has even traveled to several houses.  We have taken a mallet to it to disassemble and move it, and the pieces are still perfectly intact.  We let our neice use it for a few years and then got it back for our 2yo daughter. Now it is in our basement and our 13yo and his friends will still climb all over it and jump off the walls.  My 2yo daughter climbs all over it and loves the slide.\n\nThis thing is tough and safe!  It does not tilt.  It's very sturdy.  There is a space around the door to prevent little fingers from getting smashed. A small child can climb into the tower and not fall out because of how the tower is designed, they can easily climb up the slide since they can use the walls to grab onto, and also hide in the \"dungeon\" (part under the slide and under the tower).  There is also a secret passage they can fit in through.  The bigger kids (and adults) have a blast hiding in it, climbing on it and jumping off it too.\n\nI'm not sure about other playhouses, but I think this one is well worth the money, especially since after all these years with plenty of use and abuse.  The color faded on the Little Tikes symbol and the fireplace decal is scratched up a bit, but other than that, it looks almost new.\n\nEven our cats love climbing and hiding in the castle!", "summary": "After a decade and plenty of abuse the thing is still like new!", "unixReviewTime": 1270771200}

At first, I was unsure that the gimmick of the Robot would prove to add anything to the game.  Boy, was I delighted to find out how wrong I was.  My son, 10, and his cousins, 8 & 12) all ask to play this game whenever we ask what game we should all play.  The robot holds the Uno cards (slightly smaller than the regular deck).  Play goes on as usual with each player taking a turn.  Every once in a while, the robot throws out a command that changes up the game.  Sometimes you pick up a few cards, other times you might discard a few.  At the beginning of the game, each player records their name so the Robot knows who is playing each turn.  The boys all love it when the robot commands them to change the nickname of a fellow player.  They get to record a new name for another player.  With three boys, you can imagine some of the lovely names they bestow upon one another.  The robot also lets them create new rules for the game.  Sometimes they make a player pick up extra cards, other times, they make the players run laps around the yard.  The educational part of the game comes in counting the cards at the end of each hand.  It also teaches basic rules of gameplay and helps teach the little ones how to win and lose with dignity (okay, some of the adults can use those lessons, too).  Uno has been around forever and can be enjoyed by all ages.  This Robot is not a necessity, but it has brought a lot of amusement to our home.

The package says 4 and up (obviously these are a choking hazard), but she's a pretty laid back kid who doesn't usually put things in her mouth. I supervised her carefully and only bring them out when we can sit together. However, I would watch her with these--even if she was older. Beads like thse can be really easy to spill even for an adult.\n\nThat said, it's not a problem. I didn't get these to keep her \"busy\" (we have other toys or give her chores for that ;) ). Stringing these beads is great for her hand/eye coordination, creativity, and self-esteem (she is proudly wearing her first beautiful necklace). She likes to count the beads and point out the colors to us (so at her age, this is strengthening her number and color skills). She can put the little ones on very easily, but needs a little help from me or my husband with the butterflies (they are a little tricky) but I'm sure she'll master them all in no time. :)\n\nBut the best part of all (for me) is watching her while she strings the beads together. It has been a wonderful bonding experience for us that brought back happy childhood memories of when my sister and I making jewelry at bead stores in Ithaca.

Its such a great safety feature that the magnets are actually in the piece, not glued on. Being an ER nurse I look for safer toys like this.\n\nThese don't have as many options as Legos, but are easier and faster to play with. We can build and disassemble something in a few minutes. The magnet is pretty strong, Im posting a picture of some stacked together and held upside down. I've had magnet toys that are so weak they fall apart easily. These are the perfect magnetic strength for my son to not get frustrated. They are strong enough to old quite a few together. I have no issues with this set at all.

I definitely had a good time putting it together.  There are no real assembly instructions, so it's a bit of a challenge, but once you figure out the numbering system on the panel diagrams it's pretty straight forward.  It just takes some time to find the proper pieces amongst all the other pieces.  The back of the box has small diagrams of the 13 plywood sheets with each of the parts labeled with alphanumeric codes, like D6, F21, etc. and once you find the pieces you need for the section you are working on it's as simple as Tab A goes into Slot A. The instructions on the back of the box say:\n\n1. First of all, check the part numbers shown in the drawings with the numbers on the diagram.  Mark each part with its corresponding number.\n\n2. Push the pre-cut pieces out of the wood boards carefully and touch up the rough edges with the enclosed sandpaper.\n\n3. Put all the parts together in order and refer to the photograph on the cover to get a general idea of where each part goes.\n\n4. Glue is required at some joints.  Glue not included.\n\n5. Before or after assembly, you may wish to stain, varnish or paint in your own choice of color or design.\n\nThat's it for instructions.  They are repeated in what looks like Spanish, German, and French, too.  Unfortunately the instructions and model itself aren't completely accurate.  It starts with the name of the model itself.  It's labeled as St. Petersburg Church, but in actuality this is a model of St. Basil's Cathedral.  Also, glue is included, although you'll probably need a lot more than what they give you, unless you want a very rickety structure.  I also found that some of the parts were mis-numbered on the diagrams.  It wasn't hard to figure out what the correct numbers should have been, but it happened about 4 times.  A few of the pieces were even cut incorrectly.  For the most part everything fit together, but there were a few spots where the tabs or slots were off by as much as 1/8 of an inch.  You'll definitely want an xacto knife to help trim some of the pieces.  You'll also definitely need an xacto knife to remove some of the pieces from the panels.  Yes, the pieces are all pre-cut, but not all of them are cut completely through the thickness of the plywood sheets.  Even with the xacto knife there were still a few instances of pieces splintering a bit, but a little glue or putting the splintered sides to the inside where they aren't visible took care of most of the issues.\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun putting this together in the evenings over the past week, and I suppose that's what matters most.  Your finished model will be pretty impressive at first glance, but under scrutiny it'll be obvious that pieces weren't machined all that well.  So for Fun Factor this gets 5 stars.  For quality it gets 2 stars.  Overall I give it 4 stars because I enjoyed it and would be happy to get another kit like it.", "summary": "Fun to build, could be better though.", "unixReviewTime": 1388275200}

It was interesting to see differences in performance. For the TL;DR:\n\nEven among each other alone, the elite mags performed inconsistently in terms of feed strength. While most pushed very strongly - making it difficult to even load 18 sometimes - they were inconsistent in feeding. This seems to be because they give a much, MUCH more snug fit than others of the type, be it standard or even the elite Firefly mag. For this reason, dart tips dragged on the walls constantly, hindering the feeds. To fix this, you have to tap or shake the mags to get them feeding again. Kind of annoying.\n\nFor this reason, I still favor the old Stampede-accompanying standards. Sure, they \"feed slower,\" but mine are consistent. No darts drag and I never feel like I have to \"reset\" them. They're a much looser fit on the darts which can cause a bit of wobble and shifting while handling, but it's nothing to worry about.\n\nIn the end, \"they're mags.\" They're a mass-produced product that're going to have some inconsistencies.

I got this as a gift for my birthday and I have to say from my first flight this thing, it flies amazing, if not better than all of the expensive e-flite helicopters I have bought in the past! If you are looking for RC fliers whether you are young old, beginner or advanced, look no further than this.\nOut of the box, this thing is fantastic. It looks sleek and I instantly noticed versus my past experiences in this hobby, the blades are very sturdy and should be friendly to newcomer pilots. After about a half hour, the battery was charged, and I did my first test flight. I was simply amazed how well this thing flew, the stability and control are excellent, and even the transmitter feels like a high-quality RC transmitter. Modifying the trim was a breeze and I really enjoyed my first flight!\n\nI simply love it, it is a great gift and I can't wait to flight it again! My only minor dislike, the transmitter light on the quadcopter itself is kind of bright, but no big deal and I'm sure it's helpful when flying it far away in the backyard. I have some first buyers tips if you are reading this. First of all, the screw in the transmitter is ridiculously tiny, I recommend picking up a set of tiny electronics screwdrivers so you can get it off right without warping the tiny screw. I bought a set in Home Depot for about $5 bucks, they were \"Husky\" brand precision screwdrivers.\nSecondly, if this is your first RC helicopter/quadcopter ever that and you've never flown, I have some tips to avoid you getting sad/upset with a busted toy. Yes, this thing is very sturdy, but I would still be cautious with it! Keep it away from pets and flight it somewhere very roomy for your first flight until you get the basics down. Find somewhere with open space or even go to a gym after hours when you can learn the basics. Outdoors is OK but only if there is no breeze, if you are inexperienced in flight, the slightest breeze will take this thing off to China! First, learn getting up and off the ground with your left stick (elevator). Then learn movement with the right stick (pitch/roll) to fly forward/back/left/right. Movement on the right stick should be very delicate at first. I would not attempt flips or anything till you are very comfortable.\n\nAlso, if you get nervous and/or are about to crash, simply thrust the elevator down (left stick) all the way and let the blades stop spinning! Let it fall, you will do the least damage in crashing when you DON'T let the blades crash into stuff while they are spinning. Letting the motors run and crashing it what breaks blades/motors/gears. Don't let that happen.\nI love this and I will update my review if anything bad comes of this product, but I love the Dromida Ominus!

A year later, I can write an informed review.\n\nThis is a *really cool* product in concept and potential that is somewhat less cool in actual execution. First, the great:\n\n- Tons of room for creativity\n- Really gives kids a project to get involved in\n- Really gives kids a sense of confidence\n- Lots of fun when things are rolling well\n\nNow, the less great, which have to do with the technology interface:\n\n-(1)- We have been generally unable to make the tactile part of this workthe actual putting little blocks into the grid. The problem is that the app relies on a phone or tablet's camera to capture images of the board as you lay out the graphicsand it invariably gets all of the colors wrong. Greens turn into blues, blues turn into purples, and so on.\n\nWe have tried it on two different Android tablets (a Samsung Galaxy Tab and a Kindle Fire) and on an iPad Air. Basically, the image processing in the app just isn't sophisticated enough to deal with average lighting conditions and average tablets. Perhaps if you have a spectacularly high-end, recent tablet or really neutral, well-controlled lighting your experience will be different, but for us it's three tablets, in sunlight, ambient room light, lamp light, and multiple different rooms and... bupkis.\n\nHappily, you can just lay out the graphics in the app yourself without having to use the camera and the blocks. But that removes a bunch of fun from the start.\n\n-(2)- The app (especially onboarding) is buggy. You know how some apps and services sort of \"get lost\" as you sign up if one little thing doesn't go quite right, and then you're trapped in a kind of never-neverland where it's asking you to do things without giving you a way to do them, or removing options that should be there based on your not having completed steps that it never gave you the chance to complete and so on? Yeah, we had that experience each time we tried another tablet. It just doesn't go smoothly.\n\nThere's a lot of \"hmm, try tapping that\" and \"but it says we have to...\" and \"I don't see that option...\" and so on.\n\n-(3)- The app is not intuitive and not well-documented. The kids eventually got there between exploring and reading and so on, but it took a while. If your kids are not absolutely dedicated to figuring this out and making it work, I can see how it might turn into a \"can't figure it out now, maybe I'll come back to it someday\" kind of toy.\n\n-(4)- The app is *heavy* in its resource usage. It stresses our tabletsall that we triedright to the limit, resulting in lags, some UI weirdness, and a lot of used space. I get that this is probably just par for the course given the features (especially the social gaming features) they're offering, but that also takes some of the fun out of it. Sometimes the kids just get frustrated with the lags and so on and move on to something else.\n\nAll in all, given the price and the ultimate potential over time, and the eye-opening concept that \"I can build a game!\" I'd say that it's worth the buy for the right kids. They should be:\n\n- Bright\n- Motivated\n- Patient\n- Creative\n- Self-directed\n\nBut it's sort of a shame that this isn't a \"knock it absolutely out of the park\" product because it feels like one of those products that had the absolute potential to be, but was maybe just let down a little bit by trying to do too much and/or getting just a little bit sloppy about releasing without being ready.\n\nThree stars and a \"recommend with significant caveats.\"", "summary": "Could have been spectacular.

So, please excuse me if you read it twice (but, I thought I'd include it here as well since I didn't know where folks would start).\n\nWe like co-op games when we find a good one. There are not a lot of great options out there, but when we find one we like it has a regular space in our gaming rotation. Just to give you a few points of reference, Pandemic is one of our favorite games and we play it regularly. Others like Forbidden Island, Forbidden Desert, Star Trek Expeditions, and the Lord of the Rings all have something interesting to offer, but just did not do it for us so we don't play them anymore (though we do sometimes break out Forbidden Desert when we want to introduce someone new to co-op games). I'd place Flash Point somewhere between these other games; not as good as Pandemic, but much better than the rest. So, I'm giving it 3 stars, which on Amazon means \"It's ok.\"\n\nWhile there are some things to like about the game (innovative mechanic, strong theme, multiple difficulty levels, and lots of expansions), there were a couple of key issues that put it in the \"it's ok\" range for us.\n\n(1) Our main feeling about the game was that there were too few real decisions to make. Most of the time the only good choice was obvious... you either move toward a victim or fire, carry a victim out, or put a fire out. Only occasionally do you have to make a tough decision about doing one or the other, discuss strategy, or plan for the future (see next point). Pandemic (which should be a familiar point of reference for many people reading this) offers a lot of real choices options/choices, and often requires a lot more planning and discussion (i.e., where and when should we meet, build, treat, cure, play special cards? What's the best way to get around the board - drive, direct flight, charter flight, shuttle flight? Should I save this card to cure disease, give it to someone else, or use it to fly somewhere? Etc.). There are definitely some decisions to make and opportunity for discussion in Flash Point, but nowhere near as much or as often.\n\n(2) The reason you cannot plan as much for the future is that both fire placement and victim placement is completely random throughout the game... You NEVER know where they are going to pop up. Pandemic (to use a familiar point of reference again) also contains a random component, but in a way that allows you to plan ahead in a meaningful way (i.e., after the first outbreak you know something about where the disease may pop up again so you can plan accordingly).\n\nTogether, these two issues took a little out of the game for us. I know lots of people love this game and I mean no disrespect to anyone by saying any of this. I liked the idea enough to give it a try, and I liked the game enough to also try a couple of the expansions. For example, I've since purchased the Veteran and Rescue Dog expansion and 2nd Story Expansion which do seem to help somewhat with the first issue I raised above. And, I'm sure we will still break out this game from time to time as it does have some nice things going for it and we by no means felt that it was bad. But, all things considered it really felt just ok to us.", "summary": "A decent but not great co-op game (better with the expansions)", "unixReviewTime": 1400371200}

This is a betting game that's simple to learn and requires a bit of luck and strategy to win. We had 6 people, which I think is a good number to play with. The product is frequently in/out of stock for some reason depending on who has it available (our friend said it was out of print and he had to order from UK so happy it was on amazon!). You basically get three coasters per player -- they are obviously popped out of a larger sheet. The pieces are really simple so you COULD make your own set, but the art is gorgeous. As noted, there is no protective film or coating on the coasters so they will get wear and tear, but we felt that was part of the charm. As folks noted, folks COULD mark the pieces so they can cheat...but I guess if those are the types of folks you play with, that's something else. I definitely prefer this art to the original game's art. I think this would be a good team building game since it lets you see how different players bet, how focused they are at winning points, aggressive/passive, etc.", "summary": "Simple betting game, but lots of fun for 6 people!", "unixReviewTime": 1451433600}

A player picks up a small square with an image on it (an image taken from the gameboard you are playing on). The other players try to guess what image the small square has on it by asking questions that can be answered with a yes or a no. Whoever guesses correctly gets to take the square image... if no one guesses, then the player who holds onto the square gets to keep it.", "summary": "A fun and well-constructed game for 4-8 year olds", "unixReviewTime": 1483401600}

It's very pretty, and the sequins go all the way around the dress, unlike some other similar Barbie-friendly dresses I saw reviewed on Amazon.\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, the bustline is made for the traditional Barbie, not the smaller bustline of the modern Barbie.  This means that although the dress stays up okay, Barbie will have several \"wardrobe malfunctions\" during a play session.  However, it's also the easiest dress the kids can put on their Barbies (and if you've ever had to dress and undress a Barbie fifty times in one play session, you know what I mean!)\n\nAlso, it's true that the fabric is fragile.  After a week of very heavy play between my kids, both dresses need some minor repairs.  But considering these are made with much finer fabrics than you'd see on a Barbie doll, and given the reviews, I expected it.  The sewing is not bad for the price (definitely not great), and the dress looks FAR nicer than the cheesy fabrics that some of the genuine Barbie clothes are made with.  All in all, I would buy one of these dresses again.  If you understand the limitations, you may be happy with this dress for the price.  But if you don't want to do an occasional repair, and want them to last a year or more, then you should skip it.", "summary": "Very nice for the price, but you will need to occasionally repair it to maintain it.", "unixReviewTime": 1452124800}

If I had it to do over, I may well have waited until she was three to give this puzzle to her.\n\nI'm really pleased with how durable this puzzle has been. It is made of really thick heavy-duty cardboard, the pictures are glossy and have held up well to a little abuse. The pieces are smooth, particularly at the edges, and appear to be high-quality.\n\nThe only huge drawback I can see with this puzzle is, as another reviewer noted, the letter x has a fox, emphasis on the last letter, which is just... wrong. I mean, why not have a xerus (squirrel) or a xiphias (swordfish) as some of our ABC books have? Really, had they put any thought into this detail, they could have conjured at least a dozen possibilities.

It tips over pretty easily because the little front feet doesn't firmly plant themselves on the ground (you can see that they're 'hanging' in front of him like little hands).

Obviously, he's still too young to play the game like you're supposed to - it's designed for ages 3-6. But he enjoys the \"pop\" action and playing with the letters.\n\nThe actual game is very simple. The child is simply supposed to put all the letters in place before the timer runs out and the letters all \"pop\" out of place. The timer has three difficulty settings - the easiest setting gives lots of time. The child can play with all the letters, or all the vowels, or a group of letters of the same color. For older players, a card inserts onto the game board with spots for forming words. The instructions say to just make the words on a card that is also included. It might be fun to challenge the child to make up his or her own words from a set of letters, though! We look forward to trying that aspect of the game once our son is old enough.\n\nUnfortunately, the letters are pretty small. This makes it difficult for our young child to put them in place (after we show him where they go). I also think it might not be as easy for him to learn their shapes when they are so small. Maybe this helps increase the challenge for an older child, though.\n\nOur biggest complaint, though, is that the game doesn't come with any way to store all the small pieces! Lose one letter, and it's not a complete game anymore. I put them in a ziploc bag in the box, but I wish there were a storage tray or even a bag included.", "summary": "Fun game, but small pieces and no place to store them", "unixReviewTime": 1469491200}

The object of the game is to rescue the princess before night fall.  The board is set up with, I think, 6 obstacles placed in a pile of decending order in the bottom middle of the castle.  Cards are placed upside down in the 4 corners inside the board: the forest, mountains, field, village. The player's pieces all start in random corners of the board. You roll the dice and move your piece clockwise around the board. If you land on the moon, you place a night piece  over the castle. If you land on a rainbow, that's a wild card and you can choose to flip any upside down card on the board. If you land on a setting space, (village, for example), you can only flip a card in that location. Once you flip the card, you see if you can imagine a way to use that item to eliminate the topmost obstacle. If you can imagine a way, you tell everyone how you are going to do it by making up a story (maybe if you get a candle, you can set the door on fire, for example).

Burtch", "reviewText": "I stumbled upon the Kre-O USS Vengeance in a Toys R Us store and picked it up as soon as I saw it.  This is the newest Star Trek set to come out in this line, and I have all of the other ones.  Each one has been a fun build, and for the most part I haven't had any issues with any of the sets.  I had a feeling that the USS Vengeance would be released at some point in time, as it was a fairly important part of the new \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" film.  I didn't expect it to come out in August, though.  I fully expected it to be a release sometime in the winter to go with Holiday shopping.\n\nFull disclosure about my brick building set history here...\n\nI've built hundreds and hundreds of LEGO kits in my life, and currently have several very nice display cases in my home full of LEGO products. While the Kre-O products may not have quite the same fit and finish as most of the LEGO products, I feel that they are a very nice alternative...and they are an alternative that will be having some licenses that LEGO will apparently never have. Star Trek being one of those licenses...so, if you want a brick building kit of some Star Trek vehicles, then Kre-O is your only option. However, I don't really think that's a bad thing. While maybe not quite as refined as the LEGO kits, I have built all of the Star Trek kits and a couple of the Battleship kits and haven't had any real issues with the builds, and the products seem durable enough. Now, mind you, I'm not a kid and I don't have any children, so I can't say that they'll survive being slammed into a wall by a 5 year old, but they aren't just falling apart like some people seem to suggest in the various reviews here on Amazon and other sites.\n\nThe USS Vengeance build went very smoothly.  There were no points in time during the build that I needed to take anything apart or go back numerous steps.  One thing that Kre-O sets require is that you pay attention to the instructions.  There are many times when a single piece is placed somewhere in a build step that doesn't really make a ton of sense.  What I mean is that you will be building a part on a certain side of the model, and then in that same step a single part will be thrown onto the model nowhere near the other pieces you are putting on in that step.  From time to time this can cause a builder to go back a step or two in order to try to figure out why things aren't fitting the way that they seem like they should.\n\nThe Vengeance has one tricky part, and it's necessary for the build the way the ship is designed.  The USS Vengeance in the movie had a strange saucer design that had the bridge separate from the rest of the saucer, and as such there is a hole in the saucer.  This is present in the Kre-O set, and in order for the whole thing to stay together there is a clear piece that must be put in the front of the saucer that moves back to the cockpit area in order to support the entire thing.  This piece is clearly (no pun intended) in the instructions, but it took me a moment to figure out what exactly it was going to do.\n\nOther than that, the build was very straightforward without any hiccups.  The pieces on the Kre-O sets continue to seem like they are getting better.  I know some of the very early sets I had from this brand had parts that didn't want to stick together very well.  I only ran into that in one step in this build, and it was remedied by putting the pieces together completely.  Basically, it was a flat single peg wide piece trying to hold three larger pieces together, and that piece alone wasn't holding.  However, once I got the bottom of the subassembly that I was building in place, the top piece that wasn't holding before had no problems staying in place.\n\nLike all of the other Kre-O Star Trek sets, this one has LEDs.  If you have the USS Enterprise, the LEDs on this set are exactly the same as on that one.  They are very bright and really add a cool factor to these sets.\n\nOne thing I wanted to note as it was mentioned in another review is the size of this ship.  It is very slightly smaller than the Enterprise set in overall size, and it doesn't come with as many pieces.  In the movie the Vengeance was much larger than the Enterprise, however, I don't feel that things like that need to \"scale\" correctly in brick building sets.  An example would be the Kre-O shuttle set.  The shuttle is obviously much larger in comparison to the Kre-O Enterprise than a shuttle would be to the Enterprise in a movie or TV show.  So, although the Vengeance was larger in the movie, I see no problem with this set being slightly smaller in size than the Enterprise, as the Enterprise is clearly the \"flagship\" of this line of toys.  With that said, the Vengeance is not MUCH smaller than the Enterprise.  In fact, the two sets use the same main piece that holds the saucer and nacelles.  So they are very similar in size.\n\nOverall, this was a fun build.  It didn't take me a very long time, but it was a fun build.  The finished model looks great, and is a perfect piece to put on the opposite side of the shelf that your Kre-O USS Enterprise is on.", "summary": "Another Fun Kre-O Star Trek Set...", "unixReviewTime": 1378166400}

This is also a downfall because if you have an age gap among players, it will put those younger players at a disadvantage.\n\nIt is a fun race against the clock (or timer) to see if you can actually build the things on the cards and how many.  So there's an excitement there.  And then, to also see if you can knock down your opponents towers.  My kids enjoyed these aspects.  And who doesn't like flinging something from a catapult.

It is everything expected, and is a great buy!

The only problem with sand is that it sticks to anything and everything it comes in contact with, especially if its wet.  Sand is certainly one of those things I don't care to continually sweep up or vacuum, but if you have a little one theres a solution for that.\n\nOne of the best things about the Sands Alive kits is the fact that young children can play and be creative sans the mess.  The kits can be used time and time again whether they are using molds to create mini structures or, in the case of the glow sand, drawing on.  I do love the little cars in this one because thats yet another thing my son adored ... cars.  Cars and truck go together quite nicely.  The track is very bright and vibrant, but Id recommend getting it laminated if you want it to last.  Its quite durable, but Im sure this one will get plenty of play time.\n\nThe proprietary sand formula doesnt stick to anything, yet is firm enough to be molded easily if you have molds (other kits come with them). Now theres a nice new twist to the Sands Alive kits ... they actually have glowing sand!  Its great fun to play with.  The sand catches a glow when the either the UV glasses or the UV pen is pointed at it.  I can put my hand in the sand and actually create a visible print.  Loads of creative fun thats just a bit different every time its played with.\n\nINCLUDES:\n\n  Sands Alive!

We had a few gift cards that we had not used, so we invested in this camera. He was very excited to get it and uses it often, he especially likes to take it on Photo Safaris with us. It is also a hit in the neighborhood among all the kids who take photos like crazy with it.\n\nPros: Seems quite durable. Buttons are easy to use for him, while the batteries and sd card (optional) are easy to keep out of his reach. Photos download easily and cable is included in the kit. The optional SD card (I got a cheapie 512meg) adds storage for over 1000 extra pictures.\n\nCons: Does go through batteries quickly- but we use rechargables anyway for most things. Photo quality is TERRIBLE- and I just don't mean terrible because we are photographers ourselves, I mean TERRIBLE in general. The photos are most frequently blurry and dark- even with flash or bright sunlight. Also, I don't think they would even print well at 4x6 but we have not tried.  We will have to upgrade him to a cheap digital point and shoot once he is able to treat this camera nicely. (I will upload a few sample shots to customer photos.) Another con is the discard photo button is right there on the back- great for them to erase the photo they just took without realizing it. It also makes a rather annoying noise when any button is pushed- which encourages the button pushing to go on and on and on.\n\nOVerall, the camera performs as expected, just wish the photo quality was better, but again, this is a camera for my preschooler so I should not expect too many megapixels I guess.", "summary": "Durable Camera, Easy to Use, Photo Quality Below Par...", "unixReviewTime": 1158278400}

My kids are a little young (almost 4 and almost 2) so they don't really play many of the included games yet and I wonder if by the time they are old enough they'd want a \"grown up\" tablet but we'll see. The screen isn't anything amazing but does the job- I've seen worse. The ability to add my own apps is why I bought this- there are some games like Sago Mini games I wanted to add. The fact that this only has the Amazon store and not Google play sucks more than I realized. Also, sometimes it chokes and won't install something from Amazon for days. I'll pull up the app and it'll still say \"install pending\". Happening right now with my ABC mouse app. So we have that on our Nabi- which is a far better tablet but the battery life is so bad I don't think I'd get another! Once I tried putting on about 4 Amazon apps on and it was pending for hours- then they all installed out of nowhere! I can't figure out what causes that so while you can add apps you are greatly limited and it's frustrating. If the app options for outside apps was better I'd give it 5 stars. The only reason this isn't getting 3 stars is the battery life is amazing. I can leave it unplugged overnight and come back to almost the same charge as I left it. Meanwhile our Nabi Dream would be dead or on its last legs even if it was 100% when we went to bed. I'd consider buying it again but can't say 100%. The kids actually broke our first one by pulling on the cable while charging and broke the port so we got a replacement through the warranty. I was seriously considering buying a replacement at that time but got the Nabii and now we have 2 tablets. Which our boys fight over since they each have different advantages and apps so there's always something to fight over! Esp if they want to watch YouTube- not goo player for that on the LeapFrog.

A dog that poops. The purpose you say? Besides being funny, it may teach a child how to be a responsible dog owner. Dogs make messes, right? It also helps them feel like they have a real dog. They can name it, feed it and care for it. Simply insert the pellets in the mouth and feed, walk the dog and let it poop. It comes with a durable plastic leash and tag. The eyes are wide and expressive, as well as attached very well. The fluff on this toy is so soft and realistic. However, it is very easy for smaller children or even real pets to swallow the small plastic pieces as far as the food. Definitely not for a child under four or five years old (unless supervised and you put it away). It also requires two AAA batteries, (again, choking hazards and even poisonous if bitten into), so please heed that warning if you purchase this adorable little toy. Other than that, I think it's a great idea. The pup is also vocal. I don't like that it is made in China, but since you won't allow the child/dog to chew on any part of it that's not a huge hazard.

She loves the bow blaster set, but this Rapid Red Blaster did not work properly at first. My daughter had to tape something down inside of the compartment that had been blocking the bullets from releasing. It works fine now and she enjoys playing with it, but I think it's a repair we'll have to do again. She likes the fact that she can load multiple bullets at once instead of reloading each time. The range is pretty far. As with the Bow Blaster, the secret message function is kind of silly; the messages can easily be read with the naked eye, and are trite. An improvement would be to be able to write actual messages and insert them, or other small objects, in a capsule inside the bullet. In any case, after exactly one reading, the messages and decoder become pointless.\n\nIt's a little unclear what age group these toys are targeted for. The pink and purple theme tends to appeal to the younger Disney Princess crowd, but I can't help thinking it looks like a blow drier and there's nothing \"rebel\" about it, whereas older girls such as those pictured on the product pages would probably prefer more sophisticated and realistic colors and designs.

I had doubted that our kids would play with it long enough to justify it's price.  But, three years later, they still enjoy it and ride it often.  Below are my pro's and con's to this coaster:\n\nPro's:\n- It's extremely sturdy, and even after multiple times assembling and disassembling the ramp, it still fits together tightly\n- It's simple to use ... your child just pushes the cart up the \"stairs\", climbs into the cart, and pushes off\n- It's safe for little children.  My (nearly) three year old even uses it by himself (though under my watchful eye) as does his older siblings, and after three years of useage, and we've never had any accidents with their pushing the car up the steps, climing in, or falling out of the cart (although you've got to be on your toes to keep anyone from wandering in front of the toy as the cart comes down the ramp)\n- Since your child has to push the cart up an incline, they get a bit of exercise\n\nCon:\n- None, really, although the ramp itself is pretty heavy (which is also why it's so sturdy, so it's not really a \"con\")\n\nFor the first year we owned it, we kept it indoors when not in use, but that got to be a lot of work to partially disassemble and reassemble, so for the past two years, we've just left it outside.  It's weathered well and we don't feel the need to bring it back indoors.  Depending on the type of surface the cart rides on (grass, sidewalk, etc.) and the slant of your yard, the cart will go from about 20 feet to a heck-of-a-long way before coming to a stop.\n\nOverall, this is a great toy that the kids don't seem to get tired of.  And during playdates or birthday parties, all of the other kids really enjoy riding it, too.

I had originally thought about purchasing a \"real\" Jack in the box that played \"Pop Goes the Weasel\". But, after seeing this & the song it played, I knew I had to buy this unique \"Jack in the box\" as a Christmas gift for my young grandson.  Even at the age of 1, he absolutely loves anything that plays music.  But, the music (if you can call it that)  doesn't even sound like Puff the Magic Dragon - not even remotely close.  In fact, the \"music\" is barely discernible at all.  At times, it may play 1 note, every once in awhile.  There are such long lag times, when no music at all plays.\n\nThere are also times, when the lid won't shut, after the dragon pops up.  But that is easy to fix.  For those having the same problem, just turn the handle backwards, until you see the little red latch on top, pop back up.  After doing that, you can push the dragon back in the box.  The tin box is really thin & not even close to what I thought I was purchasing.  I would think for the price of this jack in the box, not only would it be made with sturdier metal, but I the music should at least play, so it at least sounds like the song.\n\nThe only redeeming quality of this jack in the box, is when the dragon pops up.  My grandson is young enough that he likes that.  It doesn't hold his interest, like some of his other musical toys do.  More than likely, with how cheaply is is made, it will probably find it's way into the trash bin before too long.\n\nHe prefers the books, Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes & Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn musical chair that I purchased for him, as they were a much bigger hit.", "summary": "Where's the \"music\"?", "unixReviewTime": 1422835200}

It contained a ton of clips from all 3 movies.  There are also bonus features on the DVD such as Party Play - which is just continuous questions with no stopping.

The way a few parts are designed to fit together is somewhat curious. The nose cone, the hood, the rear cover and body panel, and the dashboard piece all come to mind. The hood could easily be remedied by adding a few more studded pieces to hold it in place better. Along with that, the nose cone has fallen off several times just by picking it up to admire it. The rear body panel is held on with just two hooks to make it angle appropriately, but given some time I think I could find a better way to achieve the same look. The rear cover includes part of the roll bar that is not attached at all to the main bar, and simply rests in place at an angle. The entire dashboard/windscreen is held on by one axle piece, and wiggles easily. It should also come with skinnier tires, to match the real Seven and not have them stick out beyond the fenders.\nThe Caterham Seven certainly is a tricky car to turn into Lego, so for the most part the original Ideas builder and the Lego designer did a good job.

Thanks to this unit we have an active club going strong.  Forgive the long review, but this unit deserves it in my mind.\n\nPros\nFun -  It is a blast, especially in groups.  This really is for adults as well as kids, and if you get a group of people together to do this, you will have a blast. There are many videos of people playing with this and previous generations on Youtube. Search 'Phoenix LTX', 'Tagfest', 'Lazer Tag Team Ops', and you'll probably find a lot.\n\nRange - These taggers (guns) have a range of about 350-400 feet, maybe further (maybe a bit less in bright sun).\n\nFeatures - These taggers have several features to enhance the playability.  a) 10 or 25 tags - you can set a switch to set your 'life' at 10 or 25 tags.  This can help balance some scenarios where differences in numbers or age/experience might make things unfair.  b) Indoor/outdoor mode - this helps reduce the sensitivity of the receivers - reduces splash damage you get while playing inside.  The IR signal can reflect off walls and make it pretty easy  to take hits, even around corners and off your clothing.  c) Accessory connectors for more options (see below) d) Realistic reload - you drop a fake 'clip' out of the bottom of the grip, much like an ammo clip.  e) realistic recoil - there is a hammer that lights up and pops out a little with each shot, and also a vibration with each shot/hit that add to the experience.\n\nAccessories - There is already a shotgun attachment developed, as well as a green dot site.  These slide on to connectors on the tagger to give additional capabilities.  There are also rumors of more weapon attachments in the pipeline.  There was also a video game accessory to let you play 1 player vs. the computer on a TV, but it was pretty useless, and you probably won't see that any more.  If you play with the older LTTO style taggers, you can actually join games hosted by the older taggers.\n\nExercise -  Depending on your gameplay style, you can get as much exercise out of it as you want.  The range on these guns is hundreds of feet (a bit less in full sunlight), so you can easily get winded running around inside the playable area.\n\nEductional - I know - it's a shooter game... but it teaches basic strategy, tactics, and teamwork, and even the younger kids are starting to pick up some of these concepts.\n\nDurability/Battery life (cost of ownership) - The taggers (guns) are very rugged - if you compare the cost of the system with a commercial lazer tag rental facility- you will make your money back in a couple of sessions of playing, and these taggers last a long time.  We are still using all of the taggers we bought over the year, though some of them are developing glitches.  Battery life is also very good - even with rechargeables (which seem to be a little less effective, but much cheaper in the long run), the batteries will last several sessions of playing.\n\nOnline Communities - Very active online community (there's several newsgroups including an active one on Yahoo, search for 'Lazer Tag Team Ops'). The user community and the available technical information on the web opens the door for tech-minded to tear them down and 'mod' them to give them additional features. You may have to solder some stuff, clip some wires, or similar, but some of this is pretty cool.  Even me, the solder-novice - has gotten into this a little bit with a few minor mods.\n\nInteraction with others - You can play team-based games of 2 teams.  The largest game we had was 36 players at once and it was a bit chaotic, but fun.\n\nCons -\n\nCan't change the brightness of the LEDs - these are EXTREMELY bright while playing at night, and not only can this effect your aiming, but it gives away your position.  We find 2 layers of scotch tape colored with black sharpie work well to dim it down a bit.\n\nJoining hosted games is painful - Mostly a complaint about interacting with older taggers - joining LTTO hosted games is clunky at best.\n\nLack of Attachments - This is not a failing in the unit, but this particular packaging. This set is a re-offering of the original LTX, which came out last year, but this set has been rebranded under the Nerf brand.  Unlike last year's model, this set is sold without the green dot sight and 'shot blast' attachment (at a lower price, granted). I believe it's their intention to sell the attachments separately, but they are not on shelves yet. In this economy, that may not happen if the interest in the line doesn't improve. That would be a complete shame, since this is one of the coolest 'toys' I've ever played with.", "summary": "A TON of fun, especially in larger groups", "unixReviewTime": 1257724800}

We have a small mix of beautiful pieces by Grimm's Spiel and Holz and some handmade items from Etsy. I have hoped for a block set like this for some time. If any of you have shopped for a little rainbow stacker of any size, you already know that they are going to cost you almost as much as this entire set. Here is what you will receive:\n\n10.5 inch Solid Wood Storage Box\n\n4.5 inch wide rainbow stacker. (Smallest blue piece is 1.5 inches wide)\n\n6.25 inch triangle nesting set\n\n4.25 inch nesting square set\n\n4.25 inch nesting rectangle set\n\nTwo 9.4 inch long yellow building planks (my son was very excited about having these!)\n\nA mix of classic building blocks, rectangles and triangles ranging from 1.5 to 4.5 inches\n\nThe blocks have a very nice matte, light lacquer finish on them. I know some people are purists and prefer only beeswax finished wood toys but I did not find these blocks to be unpleasant to the sense of touch or smell at all. There is no chemical smell to them whatsoever.\n\nWhen the blocks arrived, my son was eagerly waiting to play with them and play he did! He set up the blocks in various configurations on our white shelf so I could take some example images then settled himself onto the living room rug to enjoy his new toy. He built and built and built. Later he retreated to his room and set the blocks up again, working with them in various ways. (In the background are his other waldorf toys. The curvy blocks are from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Grimm-s/dp/B001CN7YV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Grimm's</a>.) I snapped a few pictures of some of his various creations.\n\nWhat is amazing to me is how soothing natural toys are. The whole time my son was playing the house was quiet and all I heard was the gentle tap of wood blocks being stacked one on another. It was as calming to my ears as it was to his!\n\nI very highly recommend investing in these blocks. They are delightfully colorful, interesting and unique. Your son, daughter or grandchild will be charmed by their simple appeal and endless ways they can be played with!\n\nI was incredibly fortunate to be able to purchase this stunning block set at a slight discount to try out before writing a review. We love Waldorf toys and this block set now has a permanent spot on our very selective toy shelf!

Boy, am I disappointed with this toy!\nTHis toy is adorable, looks good, and it is recommended for 6 months and up.  Our son is 7 1/2 months and is in the perfect age for this and loves to play with this toy.  He loves to play with the rings and put them in his mouth since this age they are teething.\n\nA couple problems occur though and all parents should pay attention here.  Infants at this age put everything in their mouths, not surprisingly, our son put these rings and big bird topper in his mouth repeatedly.  Well his lip got cuts on it after he was teething and chewing on this toy.  I took the toy away and inspected it again and now noticed that the big bird topper edges on the underside part of the orange ring are sharp!  Now I felt the sharpness before allowing our baby to play with it but did not think it would cause him harm..  So, yeah, stupid me!  Awful design flaw for sure to even say that this is for 6 months and up with this design problem is also stupid and wrong!  Anyhow, I took the big bird topper away from our baby and allowed him to play with this toy without the big bird topper.\n\nWell today he was playing with the colored rings as I sat their right with him and he was chewing on them and rolling around and the yellow ring fell out of his hands onto his head.  That normally wouldn't be a problem with other soft plastic toys, but this is hard plastic.  This caused a red raised bump on my baby!\n\nSo, two things blatantly wrong with this toy; 1.) the orange ring with big bird's underside is sharp and will cut your baby! so be aware and 2.) if the baby drops it on them because its a hard plastic it will hurt!\n\nAwful!  Save your money and buy something else..\n\nGood Luck..", "summary": "Disappointed, it cut my sons mouth! & hurt his head!", "unixReviewTime": 1329177600}

We have some \"all around\" (including video format) gamers, but we *all* sit down, at least once a week, and dedicate the evening to a table game.\n\nThis tabletop version of Escape the Room was a blast! I have to say personally, my *only* disappointment was realizing the game is a \"one-off.\" That is, once you've played it with a group, you've solved all the puzzles and in a sense, consumed the game. (All is not lost -- the game website includes clear directions for packing the game back up to be used again by a new group of players). As it is, as soon as we finished, I was online seeking out more versions of the game!\n\nFor those not familiar - this is not a typical game that pits players against each other. Rather, players must work together to attain the game goals. In other words, everyone wins... Or no one does! It's important that your guests/players understand this before starting the game. We've spent some time working on different games with a similar approach (such as Forbidden Island), so we have been through the learning process of how to work in conjunction (and not against) each other.\n\nWe got through the game more quickly than the instructions estimated. I believe that this is because many of the tasks in the game involved puzzle solving. In our family, most of us enjoy puzzles... BUT, we all enjoy different types of puzzles. This was a *huge* advantage, because if one of us didn't recognize a puzzle type, another did... I think the estimate of two to two-and-a-half hours is very fair, especially for a group who does not  regularly play together.\n\nIf you enjoy tabletop games, solving puzzles, or even just spending time with friends in an activity-focused evening, I heartily recommend this game.\n\nI received this game free for testing purposes. Any and ALL opinions given by me here are mine, alone.", "summary": "We LOVED this game!", "unixReviewTime": 1459900800}
