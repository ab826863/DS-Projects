Other than the beautiful blue color, the first thing that caught my attention was how thick and heavy it was. I was not expecting that it was so robust and so thick. Of course, I am very glad that it is.  Ill not repeat all the features in the description.\n\nQuite honestly, I was literally about to purchase an electrostatic mat when this became available to me - probably because of the many electronics kits, deluxe soldering iron station, and numerous other related items I've been buying over the past few months.  My wife will build a digital oscilloscope kit I recently purchased here on Amazon along with several other kits and a multitude of basic components to build things from scratch.\n\nThis electrostatic mat is literally a foundation of a learning exercise using sensitive electronics. It is not the least bit fun to build something complex and an unknown part became defective during assembly. Which one?  To truly learn electronics, you really should start at the bottom and be hands on to learn how it all works at the component level.  Today's youth just want to skip the basics, but in doing so, they won't learn much unless you know how resistors, capacitors, inductors, and transistors work. Otherwise, it won't ever become second nature - just theory.  My wife already knows how to build desktop computers, rather well in fact.  So this is the next step now that she's developed a strong interest.\n\nWith sensitive components, it only takes one zap of static electricity to ruin something - especially in winter when the air inside is very dry.  I am very glad to have this electrostatic mat just in time to start building some projects so that it will protect the components as she assembles the oscilloscope kit. She needs a visual aid. That is why she will build the oscilloscope first. Maybe with the knowledge I impart, she can become an electrical engineer.  After being widowed 9 years, I realized I needed a much younger healthy wife with no kids.

It is always so hard to turn any such items down, because you never know what you might be missing.  ;-)\n\nWhen I revived a request to review the RT-20 flashlight, I immediately noticed it had a rotating head!  Very cool...so I immediately accepted the offer and hoped the light would be decent.\n\nWell, to my surprise, the RT-20 has turned out to be a lot more flashlight then I had ever expected.  For my uses, this is an amazing little guy that is extremely bright, lasts for very long periods on high (well over an hour with no charge!).  The manufacture says it is good for 220 hours on low.\n\nOh, did I mention the unit has a rotating head, allowing me to get my light beam exactly where I want it.  That is an important feature around the ranch.\n\nThe light is rechargeable (18650 battery) and had 1050 lumen output, which I find to be very bright on high...better than expected.  The beam range is also long at approximately 500 feet.\nBut what is really cool, is it has a battery indicator light on it, which is a feature I really appreciate.\n\nIf the power remaining is indicated by lights:\n\nGreen:  75%-100% power remaining\nOrange:  30%-70%  power remaining\nRed:  Less then 30%\n\nThe light has 6 different light modes:\n-1.  Turbo\n-2.  Low\n-3.  Medium\n-4.  High\n-5.  SOS\n-6.  Strobe\n\nThe flashlight is rated IPX 8...very impressive.  I am use to IPX 6 and 7's being sent to me at this price.  In case you are not familiar with the IPX rating system, I would like to take a minute to give you a little background, which I think will really open your eyes on items you have been buying.  This cursory understanding of this system, and how it works can prevent you from breaking an item in the future.\nFor the experienced buyer, please just skip this section.  Thanks.\n\nLuckily, since other reviewers did such a good job explaining the lights mechanics, I will take a couple. I used to explain this, as a small understanding might prevent you from damaging a good piece of equipment.\n\nThe information below relates to IP Standards, as it relates to water proof and water resistance of the object.  Just simply, as your number gets higher, so does your water proofing.  You will get the idea when you read the list....\n\n- IPX0  This means its not water resistant at all.\n- IPX1  This will protect a device from some water drops that are falling vertically on said device.\n- PX2   This will protect your thingy from some water drops when the device is tilted up to and including 15. If you have your device at 16, your device is not protected!\n- IPX3  Getting better, you can now spray your gear up to 60 from the top of the device.\n- IPX4  Now we are getting somewhere. This will keep yo ish chill from splashing water from any direction.\n- IPX5  Protects your stuff from water jets at any direction. Even kids super soakers!\n- IPX6  Protects from powerful water jets.\n- IPX7  Fully splashdown. If you drop your device in water up to 3 feet your device is still going to work.\n\nAnd now for the RT-20:\n- IPX8  You can protect your device in water over 3 feet. This is for your stuff at the bottom of a pool, lake, or even a super deep hot tub!\n\nOkay, I am very impressed.  This company could have gone with just an IPX7 to save money, but they went all out, and upgraded it to an IPX8 for that extra protection.\n\nA few other, important facts.  The aluminum LED flashlight only weighs 3.4 ounces.  It feels very well built.  The lens is made of glass.  The dimensions are 5.7\" X 0.9\" X 1\".  The dimensions make it easy to handle.  Also, I just not used this is a brand new light, just released March 30, 2016.  Maybe that is why it has all the bells and whistles.\n\nI could go on and on, but suffice it to say the RT-20 is now on my Top 10 list.  Awesome flashlight!  I would like to buy a second one for my car.", "summary": "Amazing little flashlight...", "unixReviewTime": 1463270400}

The wire mesh rack also bows with the little weight that is on it. It's getting the job done but you can not store items like the picture shows. I would NOT trust to hang a bike from the bottom of the rack. It would probably hold, but the bowing would get worse.\n\nI'm happy that it is working and cleaned up my garage, but am a little worried about the longevity.

Couldn't they just make it the right size and call it a day?\n\nI used this with a plunge router and you will be surprised how much force you need to exert to plunge it. It is enough to lift the entire table. So it is better to plunge it almost all the way before installing the plate and then use your micro adjustment to raise and lower it. Mine gives about an inch of lift.\n\nThe dust collection port is about useless.

However higher mAh battery should work somewhat longer between recharges.\n\nDEWALT recommends recharging XRP Ni-CD battery immediately when power drop is observed.  Do not completely discharge the battery before recharging as this will reduce battery life.\n\nNi-MH has less memory effect than NI-CD so this battery unit may be charged or topped off before needing recharging.

And every time I look out my door at night or sit on my porch at dusk, the lanterns just \"make\" it look PERFECT! They are a \"10\" in my book!!  When other people write negative things about this lantern, like \"cheaply made\" or whatever, I think you would have to be about a foot away from it to think that, and even then, I DON'T THINK THAT! They look like they could be $100 apiece, and they are so inexpensive!  I've had mine out for nearly a year and they are still bright at night (well, it's a subdued brightness, just like you'd expect, not like 140 lumens, more like a 50.)  They have lasted beautifully through the snowy winter, also.  Love these and highly recommend.  My neighbors complement them, too.  (Update: 5/25/18, had these babies up for 1 1/2 years now, and love them more than ever!!

I also found that the thrust bearings on the saw are not the best\nthey used a mounting where the blade hit the side of the bearing, the best I think hit the bearing from the front.\nCarter makes a replacement kit for this but its $179 I think, a little expensive.

I own one and bought one for my brother in law and nephew.  So far I am very happy with this flashlight.  It comes with 4 aaa batteries which was a plus.  You have to unscrew the battery cap and take out the security plastic so the batteries can make contact.  I'm a collector of flashlights and this was a great addition.  I don't have a way to test brightness, but according to my other flashlights I would say that it pretty much is what the description says that it is.  The magnet is very strong and comes in handy for many uses whether at home or in a car.  I just love the fact that it is a regular flashlight or slide it to make it a area work light.  You have just one button.  One push and the light comes on and push it again to turn it off and the next time you push the button the area light comes on.  There is a green ring that lights up so you know the area light is on and just slide it or turn it off and on to get back to the regular flashlight.  The only thing I would change is the on/off button.  I would have liked it to be designed to hold the button down to access the area light so you wouldn't have to turn it off and on to change from flashlight to area light.  That would drive the price up probably so I'm ok with it the way it is, that was just a thought.  Overall I'm really pleased with this flashlight and so far it is working great.

They offered me a replacement motor that was two speed for $150.  I accepted and they shipped it to me. QuietCool has a video on their web site on how to replace a fan motor.\n\nSo I took the fan unit out of the attic, leaving the duct work.  When I disassembled the motor housing, I discovered that the motor I had was exactly the same as the motor they shipped me - but the red wire (the half speed connection) and the ground wire had been cut off.  I was able to solder a wire to each - the red and ground wires. I tested the motor and it worked fine at half speed.  Luckily, the way I had wired the original unit gave me enough wires to run it as a two speed unit.  I bought a single pole, double throw, center off Decor switch to control the unit.  Works fine now and is MUCH quieter on half speed than at full speed.  I'm able to run the fan at night now.\n\nI contacted Quiet Cool and they approved my returning the motor to them.  To their credit, they refunded the entire amount, including the shipping cost.  All I had to pay was the shipping to return the motor to them.  Kudos to Quiet Cool.\n\nThe thing I'm wondering is why did they cut the red and green wires on the motor of the unit they sent me?  The two speed unit is the same price as the one speed unit so why cripple the unit like that?\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n[Original review - 9/19/2012]  Where I live, we often have cool evenings and nights, even if the day is warm (or hot).  I wanted to have a fan that could bring in the cool evening air to save me some money on air conditioning.\n\nThere's good and bad about this unit.  The good:\n1. The grill that shows in the ceiling is not very obvious.  The flappers are up above the grill so they don't show and the vent is flush with the ceiling.\n2. Installation is not too difficult and the instructions are very clear.  The fan will not fit through the vent opening so it has to be brought up through the attic access panel.  I took the duct work off of the fan so that I could transport the duct separate from the fan. If you do that, mark the location so you can put the screws back into the same holes.\n\nThe bad:\n1.  It's not as quiet as I was led to believe.  I called Quiet Cool and discussed this with them before buying the unit.  They said it was about the same noise level as an air conditioner and that it could be installed in the bedroom and run during the night without problems.  That certainly is not true for me.  The unit has a significant \"air movement\" sound that is objectionable for use during the sleep hours, and I have the fan installed in the hallway outside my bedroom.\n2.  At 3200 cfm, the fan does not bring the cool air in very quickly.  I think a larger unit, or multiple units of this size, would be needed to really cool the house off in a reasonable period of time.\n\nPart of the noise problem may be that the intake area is somewhat small, being designed to fit between two ceiling joists.

There are two red, and five white LEDs, arranged to provide a nice wide field of coverage.  Maximum output is 100 lumens, with all five white LEDs on.\n\nPowered by three AAA batteries (which are included), the unit is controlled by the power button located on the top of the lamp.  Pressing once puts the headlamp into the red light mode.  Continuing to press the button, causes the light to cycle through the various modes, finishing with the strobe mode.\n\nThe performance of the headlight is very good, as it provides a nice level of illumination, over a fairly wide field of view, however there are other aspects that majorly detract from the products usability.  The headband lacks a piece that goes over the top of the head, which makes the light prone to sliding around, depending on how much you move your head, and the amount of hair you have.\n\nThe real annoyance is the way the hinge operates.  A plate rests against the forehead, while the light clicks through to one of four positions.  The problem is that in the first two positions, if you look up, or tilt your head upwards, gravity causes the headlamp to swing back so that it rests against the forehead.  If you are looking around, and moving your head up and down, having to adjust and reposition the light, can quickly become ridiculous and frustrating.  Having the light bang against your head, gets pretty annoying as well.  When you pivot the light into the last two positions, it does lock into place, but you also begin to get some glare in your eyes.  So there are some BIG practical issues with this product.\n\nWhile the luminaire is a very good 4 star performer, the poor design drops my rating to just 2 stars.  When I use a headlamp, I frequently need to adjust the angle of the light, and having a headlamp that automatically repositions itself is quite maddening.  I own a number of headlamps, and this Energizer is the only one that does something this crazy.", "summary": "versatile light source, with a really annoying quirk", "unixReviewTime": 1384387200}

It has unpainted stucco on it. This stuff matches exactly. I used it to fill a hole that appeared around the frame of a door after my house was power washed. I just used my hands to slap it on and then I smoothed it a bit with a pain multi-tool. Since it was a deep hole, I ended up doing this twice. It took just a few moments each time. You cannot tell the difference between the original stucco and this. This was about two weeks ago and it has held perfectly. I couldn't be more pleased.\n\nI will note, that in buying a second container, I found it to be of a different consistency than the first. It was a bit dried out, I think. I was still able to use it, but based on what other say, there is, perhaps, a consistency problem or maybe a container problem. If you find that you receive a container with a broken or open lid, you would be best off returning it and trying again. Dried out, this stuff is really not usable. A bit dried out, it can be hard to work with.\n\nUpdate - Fall 2015\n\nI had a serious crack in two places on my house. One I had repaired professionally. It is already cracking again. The other I had a handyman fix by putting on some silicon, letting that cure, and putting this over the silicon. This latter choice was the one to make. For substantially less money, I have a well-repaired area on my house. Once it warms up again, I am going to have the handyman use this patch over the area that the so-called professionals repaired.\n\nThe pictures I included show the before and after of a pretty serious crack that was on the sidewall on my driveway.\n\nUpdate January, 2016\n\nSome months have passed since I first used this product to repair a hole around my doorway. Now even I don't remember where the hole was and I cannot find it. I pointed out the general area to guests, they couldn't find it either. If you have painted stucco, this won't match exactly, but it should do the job of covering up the area. You will just need to paint over it later. I cannot speak to how this holds paint. If you have unpainted stucco, you may find that this matches precisely, as it does on my house.

The old unit had a dedicated Light button to illuminate the display.  This unit has no such light, however the unit will light up when any button is pushed.

I do this with both my laptop and my android phone.  Sadly, there is no Kindle app yet.  When accessed online, you can make any temperature and schedule changes as needed.  You can also change fan settings.  You can not make performance changes to the system though, as these must be done at the unit.  One pet peave about the online access though, it displays the outdoor temperature and humidity, yet the temps do not always align with what is found via the standard weather sources, sometimes the temp has been up to 15 deg f off.  Today it is about -3 at home, yet online the stat says it is -12.\n\nI have found that with this unit installed, my furnace has been running very smoothly and not nearly as hard as with the old unit.

Combined with batteries, this little light can shine appx. 2500 times before replacement batteries are needed. That's a lot of use!

The light can be installed anywhere.\n4. It comes with a 1-year money back guarantee.\n\nWhat Could Be Improved\n1. You may need to get additional tape to keep the light mounted on the wall.\n\nI received this solar motion light free for testing and review purposes. Note that this little light is not really designed for outdoor use. But it would make a great gift for an elderly person who wakes up during the night and needs to go to the restroom.

I bought this kit in February, 2009. I don't use it day-after-day for weeks on end, but I have put all the tools (even the flashlight is powerfully bright) through their paces. All tools perform well enough for me but I use the cordless drill and impact driver the most by far. These are the first drivers I've owned that have headlights in the form of an LED. I love this feature so much I'll never do without again. Once you have them, you realize how often you're working in a poorly illuminated area.\n\nMy one complaint about the cordless drill is that the function selector - the sliding switch on top that allows the user to select either drill, screw or hammer-drill mode - will sometimes get stuck. Usually I have to loosen/tighten the chuck and pull the trigger quickly to get it to move to another position.\n\nNo complaints about the impact driver. It's solid and has plenty of power.\n\nThe circular saw is a little wimpy as others have mentioned. But with a sharp blade and charged battery, it handles 2x stock pretty easily. And most of the time, I'm only cutting a few pieces at a time and it's much easier to reach for this small, lightweight saw than my 10-lb plug-in.\n\nRecip saw has worked fine for me. I use this guy the least, and then only for a few cuts so I can't say how well it performs day in and day out.\n\nThe angle grinder is just ok. The blade shield does not have a quick-release so each time you want to reposition the it you have to grab your screw driver, loosen, reposition and tighten. I try to tighten it just enough to keep it in position, but loose enough to move it by hand, but that doesn't hold for very long of course. It'll start to slip which results in much cursing. I have a Makita plug-in angle grinder with a quick-release shield. Almost every time I use my cordless grinder, I've needed to shift the shield position, often more than once. And each time, I curse Makita for this penny-wise, pound-foolish choice.\n\nNow, to what I consider the important part of the review: the Power Source. If your batteries are unreliable or insufficient, there really is little point in owning battery-powered tools. Let my experience (or lack of) be a lesson to you if you're considering buying any rechargeable battery-operated device.\n\nBe absolutely sure about the protocols of use and charging for your particular brand/model/type of battery before you embark on your making and destroying. If there's nothing else from this review you take away (it's already getting long-winded), you should know that with these Makita Lithium-ions, you should charge them up as soon as you notice the power in your tool decreasing. I repeat. AS SOON AS you notice the power in your tool decreasing. AND, although you can leave the battery in the charger after it has fully-charged (it will go into trickle-charge mode), you should not put a fully charged battery back into a charger. The manuals of both the Makita Fast Charger and individual tools that come with this kit offer conflicting and confusing instructions about battery-charging. And frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if it were intentional. One replacement battery for the LXT tools costs about $70.\n\nI bought the LXT601 in February, 2009. After about a year and a half (warranty is only one year) both the batteries start to intermittently fail to charge. When this happens, the Fast Charger blink pattern indicates that the batteries are \"damaged\" and cannot be charged. I'm usually a good manual-reader but in this case, I didn't read them carefully enough*. I can't remember whether the batteries in this kit themselves had a manual but I have nothing in my operating manual files (i.e. I save all my operating manuals in a cabinet). Upon rereading the manuals, the Fast Charger does not warn against overly discharging the Li-ion batteries.\n\n*However, the individual tool manuals all note the following: \"Charge the battery cartridge before completely discharged.\" BUT IN THE VERY NEXT SENTENCE SAY, \"Always stop tool operation and charge the battery cartridge when you notice less tool power.\" Well, which one is it? If you don't read those two sentences and immediately get authoritative confirmation of which protocol is correct, you may end up like me and unconsciously tell yourself that it really doesn't matter what you do as long as you don't drain it all the way before recharging, because hey, these are contractor-grade tools right? If you notice your drill's torque getting weaker but you only need to drill another 10 screws should you have to worry that you might be significantly shortening the life of your battery if you proceed to drain it further?\n\nbtw, without a lot of effort, you'll find a fair number of frustrated Makita LXT series tool owners complaining of pre-mature battery failure. Some even mention getting free replacements from Authorized Service facilities for batteries that were past their warranty date.\n\nSo when I called Makita sometime late 2010 in an effort to get my out-of-warranty batteries replaced, the arrogant service rep. insisted my pre-mature battery failure was due to user error and not faulty batteries because 1) the number of manufacturing defects was very, very small and 2) I'd obviously been draining them all the way down because that's why these batteries fail prematurely. It sounded like she had dealt with her fair share of battery calls. I admitted that I'd sometimes run them even after noticing power decreasing. Not to dead, but to no-longer-useful. That sunk any chances of replacement I had if I'd had any to begin with. Unfortunately I didn't point out the conflicting manual directives because I hadn't re-read them like I did just recently. I should have, I know.\n\nIn any case, after the fruitless call, I took my croaking batteries to a local Authorized Makita facility. They were now failing to charge about 50-75% of the time. The tech hooked up the batteries to his special battery machine and told me each battery reported about 60 charge cycles, a woefully low number of cycles for batteries that were near-useless. He was able to verify that one battery, which initially reported \"charging\", reported as \"damaged\" in short order. The other battery seemed to take a charge successfully. He admitted be couldn't explain why the failure was intermittent but he was willing to sell me new batteries because mine were no longer covered by the warranty. Like the service rep on the phone, he told me that I should remember to charge the batteries when I notice the power decreasing. Unwilling to fork over another $140 to Makita, I took my semi-damaged batteries and left in disgust.\n\nIt's now November 2012 and I am (not quite) happy to report that I still have those batteries which, after a few charge/discharge cycles where I put them into the charger as soon I noticed power decreasing, now rarely report a \"damaged\"/can't-charge condition.\n\nbtw, there is another confusing set of battery instructions you should be aware of:  In the tool manuals, the instructions say to \"Never recharge a fully charged battery cartridge.\" The Fast Charger manual says under the Trickle Charge (Maintenance Charge) section: \"If you leave the battery cartridge in the charger to prevent spontaneous discharging after a full charge, the charger will switch into its 'trickle charger (maintenance charge)' mode and keep the battery cartridge fresh and fully charged.\"\n\nIn other words, it's ok to leave the battery in the charger, but not ok to take it out after it's successfully charged and put it back in; or leave it in there if the power to the charger is accidentally cut off then turned on again. These instructions can only lead to the conclusion that the charger doesn't have the circuitry to detect how much charge is on a newly attached battery and respond appropriately.\n\nSo beware: If you're not careful about your battery usage, they turn into the ink jet cartridges of your power tool world.\n\n*********************\n\nUpdate 9/8/14: I'm happy to report that the two batteries that came with this kit are still useful and have been charging successfully almost every time I put them in the charger. I'd say 9 out of the last 10 times. Remember to swap out the battery as soon as you start noticing power decreasing in your tool.", "summary": "Good for homeowner, but batteries need pampering", "unixReviewTime": 1353628800}

I liked the idea of being able to have some of my lights on plugs like these because I could see many great uses for this, especially when I was away from the house.\n\nWhen I received this and took it out of the box, I found it to be lightweight and seemingly simplistic in exterior. When I looked through the instructions it also seemed that it would be simple to setup too. My initial impression was not incorrect. You have to connect to this with an app on your phone. I have an Android phone, and found that the download of the app and its' use was easy to install and use. Once I connected the app, I found that it immediately connected to the lamp that I had it connected with. I did find there was a short delay (only about 20 seconds) from when I connect the app to when it turns the lamp on itself. I found that it worked both at home and away from home. I tried using the application when I was about 20 miles away and even a bit closer and when my family got home they told me that the lamp was on.\n\nSo thus far this does a great job and definitely meets a need that we have. Seeing that our whole family is busy, we came to find that there were some nights when it was not until it was dark that we got home. That being said we were able to turn on the light when needed to light up the home at a certain point in time. We also went away on vacation, and this allowed us to turn on and off a light when we wanted making the home look lived in while we were away.\n\nAll-in-all, thus far I am enjoying this and am even thinking of moving this to another lamp in another room, but time will tell if that is what we decide or not.\n\n*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*", "summary": "Works well from near or far!", "unixReviewTime": 1425772800}

Baker", "reviewText": "I was in the market for a small general purpose flashlight and the positive reviews led me to the this one. My goals were:\n\n1) LED-based for high brightness and long battery longevity\n2) Use of standard AA batteries\n3) Durability\n4) Ease of use\n\nThis one fits all those criteria and so far I'm pretty happy with it. It's extremely bright. I see people squabbling over lumens and comparing one light to another in some of the other reviews. Whatever this one measures out at, it's plenty bright enough for any conceivable purpose. Where I think it differs from some of the other lights is that it has a wider angle. Thus it's not quite as good for eliminating a fixed \"spot\" at a distance as some other lights. It's more than adequate in service as a general purpose light, and it excels at giving a broad beam at close range (Terralux specifically recommended this one for technicians needing to illuminate areas behind panels, etc).\n\nUse of standard AA batteries is definitely a plus for me. I find them much more convenient than AAA or some weird lithium specialty battery. I've tried it with both the included duracell alkalines and some Apple rechargeable (like rebranded eneloop NiMH). It performs well on either.\n\nAs far as ease of use, it has a simple click-on/click-off tail switch. You give it a quick tap to switch between intensities. No weird turns or tilts or multi-clicks. For a general purpose light you want it to be simple.\n\nSo far it seems quite durable. The button in conveniently recessed in the tail. The case it all metal. There's an O-right seal for the battery chamber.\n\nIt's good enough that I'm probably going to stock up on more of them.", "summary": "Bright, Convenient, Durable, Easy to Use", "unixReviewTime": 1326412800}

I wouldn't pry steel plates with it but in the woods, there's precious nothing that would break this.  The serrations on the blade are nice if you need to quickly cut a rope or twigs.  I found the serrations very aggressive.\n\nI will say that the grips on this blade are a big part of the selling point.

Our home was one of the last to have power restored, so we had plenty of time to test the Energizer LED Folding 360 Area Lantern.\n\nInitially, I loaded four AA batteries into the lantern but we switched to eight (as per the instructions) for maximum run time during the power outage. The smart dimming technology is fantastic. We could `tap' down the light intensity, allowing us to use the lantern at the dinner table without blinding anyone. With a couple more taps, my family could ramp up the light intensity for use down the hallway.\n\nThe caveat here is Energizer's decision to use plastic screws to hold the battery compartment. We stripped the screws on our first try, so now they fall out of place if the lantern is rotated too much to its front side. This isn't a problem so long as the textured, plastic lid is closed. The lantern has a durable, easy-grip handle and a retractable kick-stand that allows the product to sit upright on a table.\n\nEight AA batteries gave us all the light we needed during our eight-hour power outage. I haven't tested in for longer periods. If Energizer would come up with a better locking mechanism for the battery compartment, I would raise my rating by two stars. For now, this lantern is two screws shy of a five-star rating.\n\nRating: Three stars.\n\nDISCLOSURE: This review is courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, which provides products at no cost in exchange for my independent and unbiased feedback. My objective is to test and review products fairly, providing you with helpful information that improves your shopping experience. This product review was not sponsored or paid for in any way by the manufacturer or an agent working on their behalf.\n\nADDENDUM (Key information to share from the comments):\n\nSnaby says:\nThey are not screws they are latches, if you look really carefully next to them there is an etched symbol showing to spin them a quarter turn to unlock. Reading though the reviews it seems Energizer should have made this etching a little more obvious as apparently a lot of people have made the same mistake and overturned the latches. Hope this helps anybody else that purchases this product because it really is a very nice lantern all things considered.\n\nJared Castle says:\nThank you. You are correct. The latches aren't intuitive and we turned them too far. Except for the latch, I have no complaints.\n\nflyer says:\nYou might edit your review to incorporate this new insight -- if I had not read the comment I would have avoided this light based on your otherwise excellent review.", "summary": "Two screws shy of a five-star rating", "unixReviewTime": 1374710400}

It's super tall, and super heavy.  But it's absolutely gorgeous, solid quality, and well thought out.  I have to admit, it suddenly made my low/mid-range stainless steel sink look cheap.\n\nFirst off, the finish.  I am in love with it. It's not your shiny \"cheap\" looking stainless... it's a nice, brushed stainless steel that matches most appliance stainless steel finishes.  It's really stunning!!\n\nIt's also easy to use and has a lot of neat features: the handle blends in so much easier to the neck. It's a little weird that to get hot water you have to move the lever forward; but I'll get used to it.  The pull down feature is a little stiff, but it works really well once you get the hang of it. It has a \"stop flow\" button on the back side of the head; so you can pause your water flow without messing with the lever. It has a spray and a flow button too... and I have to say, the flow on this thing is MEAN.  Almost a bit too much, it's a powerhouse, that's for sure!\n\nActual structure is sooo solid.  Really nice, metal pieces, not a whole lot of plastic and strong in all the right places. I see this faucet lasting for forever.\n\nMy only complaint is that my sink is apparently too weak to handle it in the middle hole. It's okay; but the faucet is a little wobbly because my stainless sink is apparently not super strong in the middle hole area; at least for a faucet of this height and weight. I had to move it to the side; and that's okay because this faucet has REALLY good reach; it has a nice, long arch to it.  I never realized my sink was not of the highest quality. LOL  That's HOW GOOD this faucet is!!\n\nIt's really gorgeous installed... very classic but with a bit of a modern look with the handle.

Email to Leatherman resulted in a notice that any attempt to modify the knife would void the warranty. That said, it turns out that if one is VERY careful (remember the wicked sharp), with an appropriately sized drive pin, a hammer, and (in my case) a small socket as platform, it is possible to remove the thumb stud and relocate it to the other side of the blade, with a pair of pliers for pressure it snaps back into place. I can't emphasize enough, doing this is DANGEROUS.\n\nThat said, I now have a knife I can open with my left hand. I've found I prefer the Gerber Evo Jr which comes out of the box with a dual-sided thumb stud and a nice flipper tab that once fully opened becomes a finger guard. Both knives, since they have open backs, tend to collect coins and whatnot from your pocket.

Love it!\n\nMy wife and I are in a house that has 2 levels and hanging lights on the roof above the garage was impossible and dangerous because of the slope of the roof so you couldn't do it from above, and I didn't have a ladder high enough to reach. BUT the you could get onto the ridge of the first level and then climb to the ridge of the second level. Only problem was you couldn't go down the roof at all because of the steepness of it. This meant we were going to go \"lightless\" for christmas this year.\n\nI did check with people that hang lights professionally and the going rate was about $175.. Way too much for me to spend. So I did some searching and found these ridge mount ladder hooks. I had no idea something like this existed. After reading the reviews I wasn't sure if they would work because people mentioned how unsafe it was, etc. But I decided I could always return them if they didn't work so I pulled the trigger and ordered 2.\n\nThe box arrived and was beat to hell, but that was ok, these are made of steel and if it can't take the abuse of UPS getting it to my house there is no way I would trust it with my life. Good news, they were in perfect condition when I pulled them through the hole in the box.\n\nI was using these on my little giant which I wasn't sure would work, but I am happy to say it did, it worked perfectly. I was able to secure both hooks (I ordered 2, they only come in single units) and did some initial tests by banging it and pulling on them to see if they would pop off, they didn't.\n\nI was ready to hang the lights. I carried everything up to the roof then lifted my ladder up and walked along the ridge to the second level, put the ladder down and in about 7 seconds felt totally comfortable and confident. There was no wobble, no shaking. These things held onto the roof well with no damage to it and kept the ladder exactly where I wanted it. I was able to then climb down the ladder which was hooked onto the ridge and hang lights along the slope of the roof. I then got to the bottom where the gutter was and sat on the bottom run and felt secure while attaching lights along the gutter. I had to climb up to the ridge, move the ladder over a few feet and then climb back down and start all over as I was doing part of the roof, but the entire time I felt 100% safe.\n\nThe cost to have someone hang lights on my rood was $175. These cost me $21 each for a total of $42. It took me less then an hour to do my lights and I saved $133 PLUS these things will last for years. This is one of the best tool purchases I have ever made, I love these hooks. If you need something like this get these, but note they only come in single units so you need to order 2. Some people say you can use just one, I wouldn't trust it. With 2 the ladder is held at 2 points which prevents it from swinging side to side. With one who knows what could happen. I submitted 2 pictures of my ladder on my roof as well.\n\nIf you found my review helpful please marm it as so!", "summary": "Love it!!! Safe and secure!!", "unixReviewTime": 1290643200}

Aired up the big 10 ply tires on my F250... took longer, but no problem at all even to high pressure.\n\nShe'll do!\n\nThere's a chance I'll need it someday for some of my construction tools, and if I do use it for that, I'll add a little update here.

You would not want to stick it on with anything permanent, because the settings and battery access require removal. I installed two of these over a kitchen sink that needed a bit of extra light.

If I could add one thing to the set, it would be a picture guide with the dinosaur names, as I'm afraid I'm a little rusty (and it's not convenient to search the internet during playtime with a young kiddo).\n\nThese dinosaurs are ready for play as soon as they arrive. They don't have a weird feel or smell. They're fun toys, ready for imaginative play. When it's time to clean up, they all fit back into their box that's about the size of a kid's shoebox.

For the price it's a decent tool, however it has some issues. First, don't try using it until you've set the spacing between the end of the tool and the little die that the connector fits into. If the die is too far out you'll break your connector. If it's too far in you won't get a good crimp. To set the spacing take another piece of cable that has already been crimped, slip it into the tool, and then unscrew the die until it is snug in the connector. Then tighten the locking nut.\n\nThe second issue is the cutter. It's worthless. Don't even bother trying to use it. Just use some regular strippers or linemans pliers.\n\nThird, you have to squeeze really REALLY hard to get it to set the connector properly. It works, just be prepared to squeeze the heck out of it. My wife probably couldn't use this tool just because of the strength needed to properly set the connector. It doesn't have much mechanical advantage.\n\nHaving said that, it does the job and it's the least expensive coax compression tool I could find. If you're only going to use it occasionally, then it's a fine tool. But don't buy this if you're going to be crimping connectors every day.

My main reasons for applying the product to my driveway are as follows.  A section of downspout empties onto my driveway, which after 22 years has caused some erosion and spalling.  Also, in the spring, I have noticed evidence of spalling due to winter freezing.  Hopefully the hardening and sealing will mitigate further damage.  Also, I like to pressure wash my driveway (1900 Psi electric unit), and my thought was that hardening the concrete may mitigate erosion from pressure washing.\n\nHard to tell how much protection the product has provided. But you can definitely tell that much less water is absorbed.  When I first put the product down, water would bead up.  But after a year, I don't really notice this anymore.  The two attached pictures demonstrate how much dryer treated concrete stays relative to untreated. In the first picture, which was taken on a wet/rainy day, you can see three distinctly different shades of concrete.  The leftmost section hasn't been pressure washed for many many years and was not treated with the product.  The two rightmost sections were pressure washed last year, but only the far right section was treated with the product.  The treated section looks almost completely dry.  The next image shows the same areas on a dry day.  There is almost no difference in appearance between the treated/untreated sections when dry.  It will be interesting to see after a while whether the treated section resists dirt/grime better than the untreated.\n\nIf I were to do it again, I would be more careful to:\n\n1) Do a better job masking off areas that I don't want sealed.  The instructions say that it doesn't change the appearance of the concrete.  That is true when the concrete is dry, but when it gets wet, areas that are sealed stay drier and appear brighter.  Where the driveway meets the curb concrete, I must have accidentally stepped on a section of concrete that I wasn't planning on sealing, and when it rains, you can see the boot print.  I used a piece of sheet metal as a shield when I was spraying the section of my driveway near an exposed section of my garage slab and house brickwork. However, there was still some splatter, which you can make out when it rains.\n2) Not over apply. I bought two gallons to treat a little less than 1000 sq^2 feet. I probably didn't need that much. Once you apply the product, the sealing properties will quickly take effect, making it difficult for the concrete to take in more product. I guess I didn't read the instructions closely enough to realize that over applying can cause discoloration. You can't notice anything when the concrete is dry, but when it is wet, you can clearly make out some sections where I probably over applied and didn't pull back the excess. Hopefully this evens out over time.\n\nFor some reason, I didn't fully appreciate the extent of the sealing properties. I guess I figured it was mostly a densifier. I cleaned the concrete very well, but some sections where some bit of clay soil found its way back onto the driveway, I think the orange/red class got sealed into the concrete. I couldn't pressure wash it off.", "summary": "Pretty happy with the results so far (one year)", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

If you have a rubber jar lid removal pad similar to this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/4-Pack-Round-Multi-Purpose-Jar-Gripper-Pad-Bottle-Lid-Opener-Colors-May-Very/dp/B005KM75N8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">(4 Pack) Round Multi-Purpose Jar Gripper Pad Bottle Lid Opener (Colors May Very)</a>&nbsp;, you can get the job of changing a bulb done. Hold the pad tightly against the flat face of the bulb, push in hard, and twist the bulb counterclockwise. After a short struggle, it comes out! Take the new bulb and put a small mark on it from a sharpie pen or whathaveyou--this mark to coincide with one of the two posts on the bulb's base. That way you can maneuver the bulb into position with both posts in the two receiving holes. Then take the rubber pad, press the bulb hard while turning it clockwise, and it will then catch and remain in place until next time. It's a lot to do just to change a bulb isn't it?\n\nTerrible design, because you can't easily change the bulbs. I just spent 20 frustrating minutes, and gave up, am looking for a replacement and see this turkey being sold, hence my warning review. Problem is, there is no finger room between the shade and the bulb. The bulb has two prongs that fit into two slots; you have to turn the bulb to lock it into position. It is extremely difficult to get the two prongs into the larger part of the slots, because you cannot grab the bulb with your fingers, you have to play games with it (does anyone remember those old puzzle boxes where you had to shake and turn a small enclosed box so you could get a series of BB's into the correct holes and not bounce them out again?). If they redesigned it so the shade came off so you could replace the bulbs, I would give it a 5 star, it's beautiful and works well. Just don't expect to change the bulbs without an enormous hassle!! BTW, my wife just spent another 10 minutes and got the bulb in, God bless her. But I will still buy something else.

Purchased on a Monday morning, the 2-day shipping estimate (Amazon Prime) was for Friday because of a possible \"1 to 2 days for processing\".  The faucet arrived on Tuesday, beating Amazon's own best-case scenario!\n\nRemoval of the old faucet was the real nightmare, but once done, the install of this faucet was surprisingly simple. They even include a tool that allows you to easily tighten the nut that holds it down without struggling with a wrench in that really cramped space.  Much of the time savings was probably due to that tool. I don't care much for the fact that the nut is plastic though - I would have preferred something metal. The faucet is reasonably solid on the sink after tightening the nut down, but it's also not that difficult to grab the base and forcibly move it. I'll probably have to go back under the sink and try to tighten the nut a little more.\n\nOther than the plastic nut, the only other thing that bothers me a little is that the removable faucet head is plastic while everything else is metal. I suppose this may be for weight purposes - a heavier faucet head may not return back as easily.\n\nAt any rate, I liked it enough to splurge a little more and purchase the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Moen-77200CSL-AquaSuite-Filtering-Kitchen-Faucet/dp/B002CRA2WK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Moen 77200CSL AquaSuite Filtering Kitchen Faucet</a>&nbsp;for the port left open by the old faucet's sprayer.

It is beautifully designed and manufactured. The soft-close and removable features both work great, as other reviewers have said. The seat is at least as comfortable as the padded seat I had before it, and it's light but very strong; I weigh almost 300 pounds, and the closed lid doesn't give at all when I sit on it (I've sat on some plastic seats that felt almost like a trampoline). By the way, the seat fits and works fine on my old generic toilet from the 1950s, so the toilet doesn't have to be either a Kohler or new.\n\nOne small thing that I didn't notice until I started using it is the very nicely designed hand-hold at the front edge of the lid. The lid sticks out just a little bit farther than the seat at the front edge only, which provides a perfect lifting point for your fingers. It's a small and subtle design feature that makes a nice difference from any other seat I've used.\n\nThe only caution I'd pass on is to be careful when you install the seat about getting the little square black posts aligned correctly. They mate with the hinge latch in only one orientation, and there's no mention of them in the installation instructions. The seat comes with them correctly oriented inside the hinge, but it's hard to keep them there while you mount the seat because you have to unlatch the hinges to do it. A reviewer of the round version of this seat had complained about this and about the poor installation instructions that don't help at all. So before I took the black posts out of the hinges for mounting I checked which way they were facing, and everything went fine.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2008", "summary": "Great product!", "unixReviewTime": 1227139200}

Read the small guide that comes with it to make sure about that.\n\nOther than that, it's a very nice light!", "summary": "Good, but be aware of lockout mode", "unixReviewTime": 1478822400}

Something like a garbage disposal seems so complicated, but the instructions are really for a homeowner. Do you know any plumber that reads the directions? The tools needed are pictured in the manual: flashlight, tape measure, SEALANT, pencil, adjustable wrench, Phillips and flat screwdrivers, small stick between 3\" - 12\", hammer, adjustable pliers, and hacksaw. The hardest thing to find may be the stick which is used to punch out the plug on the dishwasher inlet (so you won't need the stick if you don't have a dishwasher).\n\nI have had several garbage disposals in the various houses and apartments I have lived in. They all looked pretty much the same. I just removed the old 5/8 HP unit that started to leak oil and kept jamming for no apparent reason (the bearings?) The replacement Moen disposal is ... how do I say it ... beautiful to look at? It looks like a part from Star Trek - something Geordi La Forge might be installing while saying something in techno-babble on the Enterprise. Not that anyone will ever see it but you!\n\nIt is so quiet you won't hear ANYTHING if there is talking, music or background sound in the kitchen. No joke, I preferred the old unit in this regard because I got audible feedback as to when everything was done being ground up. The Moen comes with a 2-foot power cord with 3-prong standard wall plug. My prior home had an electrical outlet in the back of the cabinet that would accept such a plug, but in my current kitchen the disposal must be hard wired. I reused the old wires since the 2-foot cord would not be long enough (and I don't know if using such a cord would meet code).\n\nYou might imagine that the flange that supports the disposal under the sink would have several parts and be a little complicated. There are nine washers, gaskets, o-rings, flanges, etc. that nest in only one configuration but the instructions have a great diagram. Unfortunately, the flange that you see when you look into the sink is chrome and it comes with a chrome stopper / sink plug. Does anyone have a chrome sink? This would look awful, so I reused the old brushed nickel flange that matches the sink.

This went on for 30 or so minutes until the HVAC and the opened windows did their job. After this dreadful event, I had to make some changes.\n\nThe Nest Protect installation is a breeze (be it for the wired or battery powered). The only thing to watch out if you're installing the wired version is to cut the power for smoke detector and test it with a voltage tester. After that, as with all Nest products, installation to your account is a breeze. Now, we don't have to worry about the smoke detector. As it should be. This thing tests itself during hours you are not home, so you don't forget to test it every month (which never happens, let's be real). If there is smoke, it warns you with a nice lady voice instead of the obnoxious, painful to your eardrums alarm. You can turn it off by pressing the button on it or through the app on your phone, tablet or computer. It even tells you where the smoke was detected. And if this wasn't enough, it works seamlessly with the other Nest products if you already own those. Helps with presence detection for the thermostat, turns off your HVAC if smoke is detected, works with the rest of the Works with Nest products, etc.\n\nThis is really, one very fine product.", "summary": "This changed our cooking life and sanity", "unixReviewTime": 1447027200}

I gave up and just went with a medium wet mix.\n- You WILL get dirty. No matter how tight you close the bag, some water will escape when you first start mixing.\n- The instructions tell you to rock the bag side to side. I found that this wasn't enough, I had to lay the bag down and knead it like I was making bread.\n- Lay an old towel on the ground to make sure the bag doesn't get ripped.\n\nIf I was doing a larger job I think I'd buy this: http://www.amazon.com/Scepter-04239-7-Gallon-Odjob-Mixer/dp/B000BPK766, as I was pretty much worn out after mixing 8x80lb bags.", "summary": "OK for small jobs", "unixReviewTime": 1327622400}

I would have preferred if it had at least 2 more outlets, but I can load up all the plugs on this and not worry about it tipping over. Plus there's plenty of space for your bigger AC adapters since the plugs are nicely spaced apart. There's 4 usb ports for charging your electronics, which is great because now I don't need to plug in all those AC adapters for my portable devices, which leaves the outlets free for other things.

I've spoken to tech support a couple times and the last time I spoke with someone who was the expert on this product and the WiFi connection and after more than 30 minutes he gave up on ideas on why it is not connecting. Keep in mind that I have three of these fans and this is the only one not connecting and that I have a dozen smart home products connecting in my home. I tried two different WiFi networks. It is clear to me that there is a glitch in this one. So while it looks great, I cant recommend it until there is a fix.\n\nAfter having this up and running for a week I'm ready to say this fan has some issues even though it looks fantastic.\n\nINSTALLATION: This was easy as heck. All the new fans I've done over the last six months (three from different brands) all have the hanging bar making this super easy. Wiring also worked great with a dual panel switch set. I was up and running in about 30 minutes and that was taking my time. This model wobbles something fierce and I can't get the leveling kit to work through it (unlike other models). It may have to do with the shape of the blades.\n\nQUALITY: This model is much nicer looking than others. It has a real glass light cover and the housing looks more solid than it feels. The curve of the blades is really distinctive.\n\nRUNNING: It moves air well. A big issue I had was that it smelled like it was burning when I first started using it. And it gets hot to the touch on the top of the main housing. I called customer service (twice, because they didn't seem real interested in helping me on the first call) and was assured that it was burning off a \"coating on the motor\" and that I needed to run it for 24 hours in each direction. Well, I ran it for a couple days in the same (summer) direction and now the smell is gone. I would have liked a head's up on that. (And a more helpful rep.) Also, this is louder than other models. I think it is because of the blade twists. It wobbles and I can hear it more than others.\n\nWIRELESS: Is ridiculously hard. The correct app is in the instruction manual for Android. Even with it, connecting is a pain in the butt. I have three different Hunter smart fans and this one has still never paired. It said it did, but then went away and won't work. You have to add the fan by scanning a QR code, put in your WiFi and then pass code. Then you hope it goes through. Most of the time in my experience it did not go through. I'm not a newbie in this field either. This is poor connectivity. Once (if) you get it set up you can turn off the stupid audible beep for light and speed adjustments as well as turn on dimming on the light through the app. (You can dim the light with the remote by holding the light button and it will cycle through brightness. You may have to push and hold both up and down arrow on the remote to make that work.) Also, I really hate that this doesn't work with Alexa or Wink. Why do all these companies keep making proprietary items? It's like a door company that keeps making you cut a different size hole in your wall to use it. Just make a standard and keep it up. I dislike the wireless on this.\n\nOVERALL: For a $300-400 fan this was a let down. It was easy to install but not easy to set up. It looks good but up close looks cheap. It doesn't play with other smart home systems (on Android). My old fan cost me less than $100 on sale and it lasted 8 years and is now working perfectly at a buddy's house. I just don't see a reason for this cost. So for now, I wouldn't recommend it.", "summary": "Looks Great, Doesn't Run As Well IMO", "unixReviewTime": 1498780800}

Layne", "reviewText": "This has been my everyday carry knife since it was introduced.  It was the first SOG knife I've owned, and I'm very favorably impressed.  Like all good tools, the Aegis has become an extension of my body.  Its use is now so completely wired into my brain that it's close to an autonomous function.  I'd have about as much trouble describing how to open and close the Aegis, as I'd have describing how to breathe.  The blade deploys very quickly and after a delightful bit of flicking, the operation becomes very reliable and second nature.  It's in your pocket.  A second later, you're cutting stuff.  I opened it in a restaurant once and my brother smiled.  I asked what was so funny, and he said the woman behind me was startled at the rapid display of a knife, even though I wasn't menacing anyone and was calm and nonthreatening in my demeanor.  However, if you ever did need it for defense, it's capable of being intimidating... and a lot more.\n\nAlmost every detail of this knife is perfect.  The body is very light and some people complain that it makes the knife nose heavy.  Maybe, but it never bothered me.  It feels great in my hand, with a lot of control, for cutting heavy cardboard, or delicate tasks that are more often a job for an Xacto.  The jimping is perfect.  The shape of the blade is perfect for my varied uses.  The shape of the handle and the fit in my hand is perfect.  The textured rubber inserts... perfect.\n\nI've never liked liner locks.  I LOVE the ARC lock.  It's brilliant and works very well.  I subconsciously thumb the ARC lock and fold the back of the blade against the back of my thigh to close it on the way back into my pocket.  There's no chance of inadvertently cutting myself in the process, unlike a liner lock that requires me to reach across the blade to unlock it.\n\nEven the tiniest details are well considered, such as the SOG pocket clip that carries the folded knife deeply, securely and discretely.  The pocket clip works in conjunction with the grippy rubber inserts in the handle to provide the right amount of grip to keep the knife in my pocket, but it comes out quickly and easily when I want to use it.  The folded shape is somewhat pear shaped and acts similarly to a watch fob to stay oriented well in pockets of all sizes, although mine is well constrained and secure in a narrow knife pocket.\n\nThe blade is easy to sharpen and it stays sharp a long time.\n\nAbout the only complaint I have, and it's a minor complaint, is the deep belly on the blade (which is great!) results in a notch between the blade and the handle.  Sometimes when I'm slashing away with the full length of the blade, sheet goods or cord can catch between the blade and handle.\n\nI thought about disassembling the knife and removing the safety lock, as I never use the safety and I don't want the safety to accidentally switch on just before I need it.  This happened once or twice the first week I had the knife but hasn't happened in the last 2-3 years, so I never bothered with it.\n\nI have not babied this knife at all, and it still looks almost new, and that includes the tough TiNi black finish on the blade and the black finish on the clip, screws, etc.\n\nIf I ever lost this knife, I'd immediately buy another.  In fact, I thought about buying one or two to put in a drawer as a backup in case SOG ever discontinues it and I lose mine.  I'd be greatly inconvenienced to be without the use of this knife for even a few days.  It's become a part of me.", "summary": "Great EDC with defensive capability", "unixReviewTime": 1355184000}

The end result looks like I spent hundreds, and it's worlds apart compared to what you normally see on the street.\n\nThese numbers aren't a stamped brass deal as I perceived in the pictures, yet I wasn't disappointed when they arrived. The backing of the number is gold, with a domed overlay of hard yet pliable, clear, jelly-like plastic. This gives the numbers a light catching and concentrating jewel effect. Application was a cinch, I used scotch tape to provide a level guide so I could apply them centered. Item packaging was well done, and assured you had clean, fresh plastic to work with. Care must be taken when removing the backing so as not to stretch or distort the number. It's best to bend the backing when you get it started and let it roll off, rather than pull it off, but the adhesive was spot-on. I know they will last for years. After applying them in the sunset today, I must admit I looked at it more than a few times to admire my handiwork\n\nOne caveat: I don't think these numbers are as legible at night as the flat white number on black background stick-ons. They're perfectly legible if you slowed as you approached the mailbox, but not so much from afar. Headlights don't bounce back because of the domed effect, but they're probably just as visible as the flat black number on copper/bronze stick-ons.", "summary": "Clean, ritzy look.

The concept is that it is a Decora-style plate with no visible screws showing. Nothing new there, those have been around for many years. What makes it different is that it doesnt use any screws at all. Instead, you slip a plastic subplate over the screws that hold the switch/outlet in place and then you snap the front wallplate to it, which is supposed to result in a smooth clean installation.\n\nThese plates would be ideal for contractors in tract homes because they install very fast and don't require extra time to install the additional screws it usually takes for wallplates. For a homeowner who wants to replace one or two plates only, there really isn't any time savings because they still have to back the existing screws out to fit the subplate around them.\n\nThe idea isn't all that bad and should rate a positive review. But there are a few negatives that erase the postives:\n\n1. High on that list is that, unlike the usual Decora wallplates, these are not adjustable. In a perfect scenario they will look fine but if your wall surface around the outlet isn't perfect you can end up with a wallplate that isn't flush with the switch/outlet. And theres no way to compensate for it. Even a tiny error can result in a sloppy-looking installation.\n\n2. The plastic used is very flimsy. That may not be a big issue when used behind furniture, but if you are using these on an outlet or wall switch that gets used a lot you may get annoyed how much the wallplate creaks and flexes.\n\n3. But the number one reason this product fails a top-rated rank is price. One would think that being only two pieces of thin plastic and the cost savings of no screws that these would cost less (substantially less) than Decora wallplates from Lutron or other brands. But no, they cost as much or more than the style that uses hidden screws. So you are getting less but not saving money. Thats not a good deal.\n\nI made the mistake of trying to use this wallplate on an outlet thats only about 5 away from another outlet that has the standard hidden screw Decora wallplate on it and by comparison this one looks cheap.  As a bottom line recommendation I would recommend these for contractors looking to save time when building/remodeling an apartment or tract home. I would not recommend them to homeowners who are after a finished look in their home.", "summary": "Is this as good as the Decora wallplate you are used to?", "unixReviewTime": 1436054400}

This flashlight comes with a well made,  electric charger, to recharge the battery when it runs low.  This flashlight is the perfect size for purse or pocket, or glove box.  The only thing I don't particularly care for is the uncommon size of battery that it uses.  It is bigger than a AA but smaller than a C, so if you need to replace the battery, you'll have to order another one.

It worked very well and was enough to do a 16ft run with about a 1/4 tube to spare.  I just used more on the ends, since several reviewers mentioned that the ends \"curl up\".  I installed this product in mid-October and the weather was fairly cool (low-60's), meaning the thick rubber of the Storm Shield was not easy to work with and indeed, since the product arrives rolled up in a box, even unrolling it flat overnight, with weight on each end, did not stop the ends from curling up again.  I ended up using a heat gun (think serious industrial blow dryer), and worked back and forth on both sides of the curled up rubber, about 8 inches away.  After about 5-7 minutes on each side, it made the rubber pliable enough to work out the curls, so it was totally flat when I moved it into position on the ground!  The heat gun did not burn, bubble or melt the rubber - but I was careful, checking it often.  Took the advice of other reviewers and bought a small bottle of etching liquid for the concrete, so that the glue would adhere to the concrete properly and this was a good call.  Finally, I used a high quality exterior caulk and did both sides of the Storm Shield, to help ensure no water could get underneath.  Also a good call.\n\nThis product has kept 90% of the water out and in my case it was really just in one corner of the garage that was the problem.

I can only speak of the climate I live in, but assume the results would be much the same unless you are living in paradise, and then you would be drinking from an artesian well\nIn the real world, you need at least one of these to stop the muck from getting into your house.\nI woke up one day at three or four in the morning to walk the dog and had a gusher coming out of this filter housing, and running down the embankment.

DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN THE CANISTER. (3) The stupid shut off head which ACTUALLY causes most of the problems, and can usually be fixed by unscrewing the flat head screw at the top, pulling the hand turn off, and replace the two (2) O-rings on the shaft. You can get O-rings that will work at someplace like Ace; just take your old ones with you to size.\n\nYou do need to have the capability to shut off the water to the unit to replace the filter, so just put in a simple ball valve since you are doing plumbing work anyway, or use your street shut off.\n\nMy original AP101T only lasted about 6 years, and when these things go (And they always go at three A.M.), you get a higher water bill, and if installed in the wrong place, water damage.\n\nAlso, all of this size filter housing use a Aqua Pure 63597174C O-ring that needs to be lubricated when installed; you can use electric grease, any O-ring lube, or Dow Corning 7 Release Compound which is what I use.", "summary": "Used over 10 years.

Power sawing is expected to produce saw dust, so I took it.\n\nIn summary, as an occasional DIYer I spent as much money as I wanted, for a saw that does the job well, and I wouldn't spend more on anything fancier.", "summary": "Value tool...", "unixReviewTime": 1362614400}

Loved the solid brass. The finish needed to be polished and buffed slightly. It was dingy when received.\n\nI was impressed with the solid brass construction. This was a selling point for me. When I dislike is the plastic mount that the brass attaches too. You secure to the wall a plastic bracket first, then you slide the top of this button over the bracket and use a set screw on the bottom to secure it. They should have used a metal bracket in my opinion.\n\nIn addition this comes with a clear plastic backing (which is supposed to let light from the button illuminate the surround) which the instructions tell you to install before the mount bracket. In other words you put this clear plastic backing against the wall, then add the mount over it and screw both to the wall. The idea in my mind, behind the solid brass, was to make a lifetime button mount I would never have to change again. Adding all this plastic crap is going to (in my opinion) shorten the life and look of the product. I can just image in 5 years the clear plastic sun damaged and foggy looking or cracked. I opted to install it without the clear plastic backing and it looks great. The sunlight can't damage the plastic mount now either.", "summary": "Great doorbell button", "unixReviewTime": 1396483200}

It gets intensive use during trim-out phases and I have had only two jams that I can recall (neither one was the guns fault). The tools-free access to the firing head had the nails cleared quickly. The adjustable exhaust flow is a real plus, as is the the ease of depth adjustment. The gun loads easily and I have had no trouble at all finding nails for it. I have been able to locate all lengths in small to large lots on Amazon's web site. I have had virtually trouble-free operation, so I am at a real loss to explain the 'uneven' reviews from users! Perhaps some of the users need to read the manual of operation a little more closely? Perhaps some are using a different angle nail strip than spec'd? Perhaps the factory had a quality control problem for a while?? So far, I have not had any problems nailing even hardwood trims such as oak, but then, most of the trim has been with softwoods and compressed foam/synthetic products.\n\nThis nailer's light weight means less operator fatigue and more production. As an aside, the Dewalt (D51238K) 18ga brad nailer is perfect for smaller 'build-up' mouldings like cove, quarter rounds, etc. I have never experienced a single jam with the 18ga. although, admittedly, it doesn't get as intensive use as the 15ga.\n\nNote: I purchased 'Grizzly's #H3401 Nail Gun Carrying Bag' from Amazons third-party vendor Grizzly. It is designed to carry framing nailers but notes that it will carry a couple of finish nailers. My Dewalt 15GA and 18GA finish nailers fit fine; the adjustable straps at the bottom of the bag secure the nailers tightly. The bag has hand-carrying handles and also a shoulder strap. I doubled over a large piece of cardboard to slip between the nailers to protect them from rubbing and banging against each other.

When I'm done turning, I unclamp the lathe from my workbench and put it on a shelf in the closet.  It takes up very little space, which is important to me since I live in a mobile home.\n\nThe variable speed control is also nice.  It's easy to dial in whatever speed you want for the type of wood and tools you are using.\n\nThe motor and tailstock bearings are very quiet.\n\nThe Bad:\nSome compromises were made to allow the lathe to be so very light.\n\nIf you don't permanently mount this lathe on your workbench, then you must bolt it to a board which is clamped to a table or workbench when in use.\n\nThe tool rest is very small.  Even when turning a pen, you'll need to move the tool rest multiple times before you finish the project.\n\nPutting moderate pressure on the tailstock end of an 8\" spindle while turning will cause the tailstock to move.  You must use a very light touch on the tailstock end of your project to keep everything centered.  This makes larger projects, such as tool handles, quite challenging.\n\nSummary:\nIf portability is critical for you, this is probably the most portable lathe on the market.

There's no belt clip or pouch to secure it on oneself and it's sheer weight means that it will flop around in your pocket unless you're wearing really tight jeans and most guys don't.  While carrying it around it would flop from side to side and weigh down whatever I was wearing, especially if I sported shorts as it felt as though it was going to dig a hole through.\n\nAnother feature I did not like was the locking mechanism as it is a simple clicking lock that doesn't always engage.  This is a safety issue as an unsecured blade can fall back into place and over the very hand griping the handle.  It's not as though the blade is super sharp (another issue) but it's a little disconcerting.\n\nLastly, after you have clicked it into the open position, closing it requires precise unlocking of the same clicking mechanism and if you have large or shaky hands (my step-Dad has a tremor and couldn't make it work properly) it becomes too cumbersome to be a handy knife.\n\nAll in all, I have MUCH better luck with Gerber knives as they seem to be built better with more quick-convenience features in mind.", "summary": "Decent but Prefer Gerber", "unixReviewTime": 1397606400}

I was told it is a generic box and when I opened it I was happily surprised to find the correct fan and light housing.\n\nThe installation documentation is a lovely booklet that turned out to be confusing until i realized it is for other lamps. I followed the single insert instruction sheet and it was all I needed to install.\n\nI had read from comments here that the installation requires two people, a warning also repeated in the documentation, but I had no difficulty in doing it on my own.\n\nMy old lamp's electrical box seemed insufficiently sturdy - it wiggled quite easily- and was mounted into the side of a ceiling beam. Because the base of the new lamp is so large, a foot or more in diameter, I was able to center it under the beam and screw it directly into the wood.\n\nThe two person part seems to be the part where you lift the outer cover onto the already attached motor housing and hold it in place while you fasten the four holding screws. I instead used my jewelers screwdrivers as temporary nails by holding the cover in place while inserting them into the aligned screw holes. Then I was able to let go of the cover in place then replace the mini screwdrivers one by one with the approved screws.\n\nThe fan / light switch is pretty ingenious and installed easily as a replacement for my existing regular on/off switch.\n\nThere is one part I'm unsure of. The fan spins up and twice I've heard a tick tick as the fan hits something internally. It was easy to wiggle the light housing to get it to stop, but after about a week it tick-ticked again and required a second adjustment wiggle. Hopefully it won't come back.\n\nI'm very pleased with my purchase .", "summary": "Love the lamp", "unixReviewTime": 1470441600}

The carbon is, of course, completely harmless but its particles are so small that will get trapped in the texture of your shower floor and leave a black mark.

There are only two of us that use the one in the master bath and it only lasts 4 months (once it lasted 5 months, I got al excited but the next one only lasted 5 months again).

First off, the replacement garage door opener is a big improvement by itself. I like the addition of the motion sensor to automatically turn on the garage door opener lights. I also like the timer delayed closing. We live in the city, so it's nice to know that it's always going to try to close the door after a few minutes if we forget. I also like that it generates and audible / visible alert when it's about to close the garage door (either from the timer or via the gateway). The gateway was pretty easy to install, but I had issues adding our garage door device at first. The gateway connected to the Internet without issue (green light), but I had problems registering the Garage Door as a new device. I power cycled the gateway and then it suddenly worked and successfully registered. The iPhone app isn't spectacular, but it does the job. Anyway, I'm able to open the garage door from my iPhone now which is my reason for purchasing. Only time will tell how reliable this device is and if it keeps on working without hassle. Incidentally, our LiftMaster Internet Gateway is connected to our AT&T modem through a TrendNet gigabit switch without any issues. I think I read a review stating that the gateway needs to be direct connected to your router, but it seems to work behind a switch for me.", "summary": "Works as advertised", "unixReviewTime": 1407628800}

I installed a forty Watt incandescent bulb, though it will support up to sixty Watts, and it seems to be an appropriate output one would expect from such a small lamp - it makes a great table lamp for the entry.\n\nAssembly requires that the cord be manually pulled through the tube on the lamp, which is best done while pushing on the other end at the same time. Before screwing the socket into the top of the lamp, I twisted the cord in the opposite direction to minimize twisting once attached; it feels as though damage to the lamp could result during this process. What the company saves on assembly labor, the customer makes up for in uncertainty during assembly.\n\nThe fabric lampshade came out of the package beautifully. Quality fabric stitched nicely, though not necessarily gracefully, with such bulging seams where the ends meet at the outers top and bottom of the shade; but light shines through it with a bright, warm glow. The base came through with only minor cosmetic flaws. There are scratches that I do not notice without effort, and because they're located on the backside on mine, it helps to conceal them.\n\nI enjoy this lamp. I've bought higher quality lamps in the past for less than what this lamp goes for. What I do enjoy is that I get to have an attractive and unobtrusive light source, without the footprint of a typical nightstand-sized bedroom lamp with its shade eating up all the space within the room.

So my dremel tool took care of that and basically  I filed it down flush to the holder. I place a large zip lock around the whole tube and holder. Installed the cam and rubber gasket and it's solid.\n\nThe only critical part of the installation is to make sure that the Blue Silicone Dome Gasket is in place, instead of the flapper, and stays in place. The connection to the overflow tube is its only support so getting it tight with cam and the rubber gasket inserted and slid down so it doesn't move up is very important. A leaking bubbly sound will be heard if you do not succeed.\n\nOnly one adjustment was the Blue Float quick flush adjustment. It needed to be slid down a bit, which is super easy, just press.\n\nDon't forget there is a minimum height need from the flap base to the top of the tank which is 10\". Or the mechanism will be two high to install.\n\nI you just need to install the one part than if something happens and you have kept the flap and handle and chain its just a quick change to put it all back together. It has a 6 year guarantee so its worth a try. I really had no choice with the California drought.\n\nNice video's on their website. It appears that they do support their customers.

Given their size, it has it's limitations as far as leverage but this is to be expected. They are pretty tough though. If I ever loose or break this wrench, I will promptly buy another to replace it.

They actually would fit in a 2 5/16\" hole if you removed the 3 little clips that are under the ring. End result is that the lights are flush with only a 1/16\" flange visible from the side.\n\nON THE NEGATIVE SIDE: I've had these for a few months now and, oddly enough I've had 3 of them die! I'm an electrician so I checked the power supply and it was well within specs. I contacted the company and they were very nice in replacing the units at no charge. However, I think I may buy a few more as \"spares\" for the future, when these may not be available any more. When a halogen bulb dies, it's easy, quick, and cheap to replace. But when one of THESE dies, you need to replace the whole lamp.\nAlso, these are definitely not what I'd call \"warm white\". Compared to the halogens they are noticeably more blue/green. I'd say about 3500-4000k temperature. My wife says we can live with it, but I've ordered some Tamiya Acrylic X-26 Clear Orange paint which I've heard could be used to tint the LEDs to a warmer color.

I am used to accelerators that work pretty much on contact. This one does not work like that. After spraying, it does take a few seconds for it to start drying the glue; about 5 seconds or so. It also takes up to about 15-20 seconds for the glue to be completely dried and hardened.  The instructions do mention this.  However, with that being said, this one dries much more clear than the fast acting accelerators. I believe it is worth the trade off. Some of the faster acting ones actually dry \"cloudy\" or \"whitish\". This one does not do that, it dries very clear on all applications I have used it for. I have used it to fill gaps, some pretty significant for pens. Use it for crack filling, and CA finish for wood pens. Works great for all I need it for. I will definitely come back to this one when I need more. Based on my experience with this product, I would recommend it.", "summary": "Excellent Accelerator", "unixReviewTime": 1464048000}

Park", "reviewText": "Overall, a very good product. But the rechargeable batteries that come with this is very anemic. After buying this at Costco, I was disappointed when I found that the included batteries were only 900mAh. Nevertheless, I wanted to give it a try. Set up was a breeze. Unscrew the battery door, insert the battery, re-screw the door and ready. My purpose for these lights is to light up my driveway. But I chose not to screw the lights into my driveway. I didn't want to commit myself to a certain location for the lights (since I'm prone to changing my mind). Also, I figured I would have to periodically replace the rechargeable batteries and the repeated unscrewing of the screws in my concrete pavers would cause stripping of the screw holes over time. So, I decided to have them simply resting on the ground (not screwed into the ground).\n\nNow comes my major issue with the Manor House Solar LED Marker Lights: the 900mAh batteries. In my first week of use, the lights would come on at dusk and then turn off after only a few hours. At first I thought maybe the lights didn't have enough sunlight to charge the batteries. But after a week of exposure to sunny days here in Los Angeles, I continued to have only about 3-5 hours of light coming from these LED lights. I thought about returning them to Costco. But then I remembered I have some 2000mAh rechargeable batteries lying around. With the 2000mAh batteries installed, these LED lights stay on ALL night. Yes, from dusk to dawn the LED lights are lighting up my driveway. Again, the difference is that I replaced the 900mAh batteries that it came with, with 2000mAh batteries of my own. FYI: I used Eneloop 2000mAh size AA batteries (purchased on Amazon, about $16 for a set of four), one each for each light. This is the reason for the one star deduction. Otherwise, these are great lights, feel very rugged and so far water resistant. I've had it exposed to rain, and water from the sprinkler system and so far no issues. I would definitely buy this again. Hopefully, the price will drop since I anticipate having to buy more 2000mAh batteries for the lights. Which is an added expense.\n\nAs a side note, please keep in mind that these lights need exposure to direct sunlight for several hours a day in order to more fully charge the batteries (ie. in order to have the lights on ALL night long). If you place these lights in a location that gets only a few hours of sunlight a day, then you may notice the lights lasting a limited time at night. Roughly, I found that for every hour of direct sunlight exposure it gets, is the same number hours it will be lit up at night. So if you place the lights in a location that gets around 3 hours of direct sunlight, then the lights will be lit for only about 3 hours at night. This is a rough approximation, of course. So place the lights appropriately.", "summary": "I switched the batteries to 2000mAh batteries and now the lights stay on all night!", "unixReviewTime": 1432252800}

Mind you, this is early in its lifespan and will have to be updated if something transpires, but it is doing well so far.\n\nSo, why LED? If you are someone that was like I was a few years prior and asks that, consider a few points. First, there is pricing related to consumption and replacement. If you look up charting on how long LED lasts, you can see that LED significantly outlasts filament bulbs. Not only that, they also provide stability and a much lower consumption rate, so they save on energy over time. As far as lighting goes, you have a much cleaner light, so it is not like looking through film. That means a lot when you want to see outside of the blurry haze many inferior types provide. They also do not get that hot, so safety via placement and touch is much better. This concerns me as a home owner and as a parent.\n\nAdditionally, this is a dimmable, and it works well.

The old one was purchased at an estate sale for 100 bucks. I was only able to cut six (6) 3-inch aluminum discs before the Tiwanese motor decided to burn up and quit working. It was built in 1983, so no telling how many hours are on it. (I wish I had that 100 bucks back now!). I went to WW Graingers to get a new motor, expecting about $125 for a replacement. Well, electric motors have taken a flying leap in cost as the replacement motor was a whopping $275!!  I could not in all conscience put such an expensive motor on such an old and worthless bandsaw. So I decided to put that $275 towards this little Shop Fox, partly because it had a 3/4HP motor vs. the 1/2HP of all the rest. (I really wanted the next model up with the nicer stand and even the ones with coolant flow). But for as little as I need to cut stock, this should do fine for a very long time...let's hope.\n\nIn regards to the stand, let's face it, all of them at this price level are pretty cruddy and flimsy, and I fully expect to build a better rolling frame out of 1\" square steel tubing (and have the saw a bit higher too). I had purchased a couple of the Olsen saw blades for my old unit, and they worked pretty well, at least up until the motor died. I don't expect to be cutting much steel anyway. (I also invested in a set of new guide bearings for the old saw, but their quality wasn't that great). One important thing to pass along is the set up of the blade in the guide bearings. You absolutely MUST have at least a .001 clearance between the bearings for the blade, and the only way to get accurrate with this is with feeler guages before you install the blade. On my first attempt at this, I did not have this clearance and the saw didn't run very well. (DUH!). Also, remember that the thickness of the blades vary with each manufacturer, so if you remove the blade that comes stock with this unit and replace it with an Olsen, be sure to put a micrometer or caliper on the old and the new and make any adjustments. At the very least, simply make sure the new blade passes easily between the guide bearings.\n\nOne other very important point when ordering this saw is to check your \"basket\" before submitting to pay. If you are being charged shipping charges...and in the case of this saw....over $100, then don't do it. If you buy \"straight\" from Amazon, they will charge shipping. But if you do a bit of hunting, you will find other companies that will ship this for free....even under the Amazon banner! (I am not a member of their \"Super Saver\" program, which I assume allows free shipping). So, important that you check this before committing to the purchase.\n\nI would not be concerned about the \"negative\" response from the guy with the old Sears unit. You won't need \"special\" blades. But for sure, the ones that come on the new Shop Fox won't be very good. A couple of the $10 Olsen \"Hardbacks\" will be a good investment.\n\nIn the \"for what its worth\" department, my \"old\" bandsaw that just burned up was cutting through the 3\" aluminum just fine, and amazingly, (at least to me), there was only a .007 (seven thousandths) difference between where it started to cut and the bottom of the cut. That's pretty good to me!! In regards to blade tension, I simply hand-tightened the adjustment wheel as tight as I could manually do it....don't put a set of Channel locks on the wheel to get it any tighter. It is also good practice to vacuum out the inside where the wheels are as you don't want those metal flakes coming between the blade and the bearings. Just take care of it and it should take care of you. Perhaps if things get better economically, I can get one of these with the swivel head and coolant system. I run a little prototype shop out of my garage so I don't have a lot of room for big stuff.\n\nI would also like to get one of the ShopFox Vertical Milling machines with the feed servo. The Bridgeports are simply too big for me. Growing up, my Dad had one of those nice Rockwell vertical mills, which again, are the perfect size. But its getting very hard to find those units in good condition, and, you can't buy parts (that's the main thing for me). If I ever need something large made, then I'll leave that for my friends at the CNC machine shop. I already have a nice-enough lathe...a vintage South Bend Type A, and a cool Atlas metal shaper.\nI made a couple of very nice and VERY professional high-definition short videos that you should watch sometime. The lathe video is on Vimeo, and the Atlas Shaper is on YouTube. I'll include some links here, but Amazon usually doesn't allow them (I don't think).\n[...]\n\n[...]\n\nSo anyway, that's my input....let the chips fly!!", "summary": "Replacement For Very Old H.

That's because changing them requires leaning way over the railing of our deck. Given this the less often we need to change the floodlights the better. This is problematic with the old style incandescent bulbs (or even the new CFLs) because their lifetime hours are so limited.\n\nThis LED flood (BR40 DIMMABLE 15 Watt (72W) E26, Warm White by Muller Licht) claims an \"extra long lifetime of 30,000 hours of use.\" Under \"normal\" operation this means that I will only need to change the flood every 27 years. German engineering at its best!\n\nHowever, as I have mentioned in other LED bulb reviews, the lifetime rating of an LED bulb can be misleading. What is usually rated is the lifetime of the LED element itself. What is not rated is the lifetime of the internal electronics required to drive the LEDs. These can, and do, fail much earlier--sometimes within days of installing the LED lamp. So keep this in mind when you see an LED rating like 30,000 hours of use.\n\nStill, for energy efficiency that it will realize and the chance that the bulb lamp will somewhat approach the rated life, using the LED Light Bulb BR40 DIMMABLE 15 Watt (72W) E26, Warm White by Muller Licht is well worth it!", "summary": "A Better Solution for Difficult to Change Floodlamps", "unixReviewTime": 1419984000}

I purchased the model with the brushed nickel finish to match the other hardware in the room because the box is in plain sight.  Unfortunately, the cover is the biggest problem.  The loosely assembled device was wrapped in plastic and then put into a tight fitting box.  No additional protection for the cover's finish!  So the sandwich of cardboard to plastic against the cover resulted in random polishing while the unit was shipped place-to-place.  So my brushed nickel finish has \"bright\" spots on it.  Makes it a real eyesore installed against the dark floor.\n\nPROS:\n- it's heavy duty, divided, so it makes the code official happy.\n- the construction of the cover is solid and the port doors fit well.\n- good gasketing provided.\n- roomy so it's easy to tuck in the wiring.\n\nCONS:\n- insufficient packaging leaves the finish blemished.\n- knockouts are all the same size, which does not allow for use of a pre-terminated cables like an HDMI, without modification (had to enlarge with a step taper bit). It needs at least one concentric knockout on the datacomm side to be more installation friendly.\n- no response from customer service.\n\nIn all, it's probably the cheapest in-floor package out there and will do the job with some modification if you have to use pre-terminated cables (HDMI is about the largest you can deal with in this box and through a duplex keystone.  The packaging is just poor.  The norm would have been to have the cover finish protected with peel-off film like other brands I've installed.  Lesson learned on saving a few bucks over buying a Hubbel unit.  Seems my only option will be to see if the metal polishing company a few towns over can \"re-grain\" the finish evenly so that it doesn't look so bad since Top Greener does not respond to a customer's concerns.  That surprised me because the company was quick to email to see if I was satisfied, and I responded with my issue via that email as instructed.  I received no reply and a few weeks later received the same email inquiry!  Guess it's just automated.  After that, I tried calling customer service via the toll-free number and nada.\n\nI've purchased hundred of items from Amazon and Amazon Marketplace affiliates.

Previous to this I was using a very simple Bench Dog jig that worked perfectly, but was limited to drilling only two holes before re-positioning and only at a 3/8\" offset from the surface of a board (ideal for typical 3/4\" stock).  I purchased the JessEm jig to allow for different offsets for working in different thickness materials.  Unlike a self-centering jig the JessEm allows you to adjust the offset rather than be restricted to centering only.\n\nThe quality of the jig is excellent, which I expected considering the price.  I've used jigs that bend and wobble when working with denser woods, but that is never a problem with this one.  It's heavy and thick, and I can't imagine the kind of force it would take to break or bend it.  The included 3/8\" drill bit seems to be a rather soft steel; it started very sharp but didn't stay that way for long... but I'm not bothered by that.  Anyone looking at this expensive of a doweling jig probably has many good bits already.  Overall I feel the JessEm is a little overpriced, but it's a small price to pay to not be cursing while I work.", "summary": "Expensive, but worth it.", "unixReviewTime": 1438300800}

They seem to work fairly well.  The temperature sensors may be a little too sensitive (I see one that's only relatively near to a vent go down too fast when the AC is running so the system shuts off too soon until I can move it) but otherwise they work.  They seem to be fairly good at detecting when I'm here or not too.  Overall I have no complaints about their actual functionality.  But the price is a different story...\n\nIf these were $20 or something it would be no big deal.  If they were $30 I'd be a bit upset, but still wouldn't knock off a star.  At their current price ($79 at the time of this review) it is a serious consideration of whether to invest in them or not and I MUST knock off points because the price is just too extreme to not be a serious consideration in whether or not even to buy the product.  First of all, hardware-wise, these are roughly equivalent to a really simple Arduino or Raspberry Pi style device with a temperature sensor and I guess it uses some simple infrared sensor for the home/away detection.  For approximately one third to one fourth of the price someone with the actual know-how to build such things could easily create their own sensor that either directly controls the system or maybe even could just emulate these and connect to the actual sensor control.  Unfortunately, most of us lack that know-how.  And they're counting on it and taking advantage.  To my mind that is a bit dirty and the practice itself is worth knocking off more points in the rating.  What's more, they don't even sell a cheaper single pack for those of us who don't really technically need two.  You have to buy two even if you only need one.  (Well, I just went ahead and put both in the same room at different points to measure more accurately how the air actually flows, but I really only needed one in the end.)  So all in all, between the rather exceptional price and the choice behind doing so despite the fact that the hardware can't cost them even a fraction of this I have to take off two stars because this is just ridiculous frankly.\n\nIf you lack the know-how to build your own then you'll pretty much have to buy these.

But there's another problem.  We live in Southern California, and as such, water is both a precious resource, and we're also inherently conscious of waste in general.\n\nThe problem with the majority of RO units, is that for each unit of water you get out, you're dumping another 4 units down the drain.  So imagine every glass of water you drink - before you drink it, take 4 other glasses of water and pour them down the drain.  This was a deal-breaker for me, and I'd have rather stuck with using Sparklett's (though, you trade-off things like carbon footprint of the truck driving around and dropping off bottles at our doorstep).\n\nThankfully, there's the Zero Waste kit offered by Watts, which takes what would otherwise be waste water, and sends it back to the hot water side of your plumbing (using a high-pressure pump to do the work).  The downside, is that this kit costs nearly $200.  Amortized over a year, the whole deal is about the same price as we'd be paying for water delivery, so it's still worth it if you can get over the large one-time cash outlay.\n\nTo save a bit of money, I took a chance, and bought the RO Booster kit, which includes the same pressure switch and the pump.  Subsequently, I called up Watts, and ordered the solenoid (~$35), and the extra Adapta-Valve ($8), along with some extra tubing ($8).  In the end, the whole cost of doing it piecemeal like this helped me save around $50.\n\nThe added benefit of getting the Zero Waste Kit (ZWK), is that you actually have to do less work in total installation.  You don't have to use the waste water return lines on the faucet (since the \"waste water\" goes back into your pipes), and you don't have to drill the saddle tube into your sink pipes.  This was a big plus since overall, these seem like short-comings of the system in general.\n\nInstallation-wise, this unit is fairly straight-forward if you're handy with a wrench - it's more just the contortioning that you're going to be doing under your sink to get to all of the fittings.  If you've got a good amount of room and a fairly new house, you'll be in good shape.\n\nThe quick-connect Watts joints are a God-send, having to use compression fittings is a hassle otherwise.  I wish that *all* of the connectors in the kit were quick-connect, but sadly I can understand that they'd want to save money with compression fittings where they don't need to be disconnected with any regularity.\n\nThe only downside with the kit, if you're not going to go the route of the Zero-waste kit, is the saddle valve.  In my opinion, it's a poor way to tap into the downstream pipe for waste water.  Ideally you'd just get a T for the pipe, and go from there, but obviously Watts couldn't account for all configurations of plumbing, so it's the best alternative.", "summary": "Adios Sparkletts.

It is bright and has good throw distance, but other than that it doesn't have much going for it. The beam pattern is very poor; the hot spot is pretty tight which gives good distance, but the spill is very very wide and too dim to be useful. There are numerous rings in the beam pattern of various brightnesses and it is not smooth at all. The balance of the light makes it not very comfortable to hold. There is a button that indicates the battery level by displaying blue, yellow, or red; while better than nothing it's not all that useful especially since it's hidden behind the protective shroud. The construction of the light itself is decent and I have no concerns of it breaking or being unreliable.\n\nThe worst part about this light is that the battery is proprietary (two 18650 batteries sealed together with three contacts on the top and one on the bottom) so it can only be charged by the flashlight and not by a charger. I initially thought the light would charge the two battery cells independently which would be a good thing, however the battery will charge with the tail cap turned off. The center terminal is the positive for cell 1, the second (middle) terminal is negative for cell 1 an positive for cell 2, the third (outer) terminal is the negative for cell 2. This setup makes it impossible to independently charge the cells which leads to voltage differentials that reduces the lifespan of them. A voltmeter confirmed that the cells do not charge to the same voltage level. Not only must you charge the proprietary battery in the flashlight but you must use a special double-male USB cable; this means if you lose, damage, or simply forget to bring the special cable with you then you're out of luck with charging the supplied battery. Fortunately the flashlight will work with two standard 18650 cells, however I do not recommend using the flashlight to charge any battery other than the supplied one.\n\nFor this price level you would hope to have more features and better usability. There are only two brightness levels, and you must cycle through the SOS mode to get from the low to high settings. Since the beam pattern has a tight hot spot and very little spill this light is really only suitable for long distance and won't be that great to use around the campsite or indoors; the low setting is too low to be helpful since the beam pattern doesn't work well at close range. The protective shroud that covers the USB port and battery level indicator button is time consuming and obnoxious; but is necessary to use to maintain water resistance. Charging initiates automatically when you plug in the supplied USB cable to charge the flashlight, so it's strange that you must press the battery level button to initiate charging for an external device; if you plug in your phone and forget to press the button you might wake up to a dead phone on your camping trip.\n\nPros:\nBright\nGood throw distance\nCan charge external electronics\nHigh quality LED\n\nCons:\nPoor beam pattern\nMust use special USB cable to charge battery\nSupplied proprietary battery is useless except in this flashlight\nMust cycle through SOS mode to get back to brightest level\nPoor design and lack of features for the price\nUncomfortable balance\nIt takes half a second for the light to come on after pressing the power button\nExpensive for what you get\nLow level too low\nMust press the battery level button to initiate external charging\n\nConclusion:\nWhile not horrible, this flashlight is nothing special at all, for the price I would certainly avoid it, and I would definitely not recommend this light to anyone. For the same price you can get much better flashlights, for example the P25 from Nitecore which uses the same Cree XM-L2 LED, also has a built in charger, is much smaller, is almost as bright, has 5 brightness levels, SOS, strobe, and beacon modes, and a great beam pattern, belt clip, lanyard, belt pouch, extra O-rings, I could go on...", "summary": "Decent if it's a gift, bad for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1447372800}

The second one simply melted and constricted the fan blade and shorted out the motor again. The third one was mounted in the same spot but this time rather than having a hot water supply line to the unit, I changed it to a cold water line hoping it would help cool the unit. No luck again. This fourth replacement is now placed higher up on the furnace hoping that would help but I am extremely doubtful. So much so that I am presently exploring having an external steam producing unit with a probe attached to the furnace expelling steam as needed. The beauty of that unit would not only be no drain line to contend with but also being mostly external which would allow repair work to be completed without having to turn off the furnace. I personally think Honeywell should have created a much more heat resistant housing than they have.

Just take a scrap piece of wood and use the different blades/spacers/chippers until you get the desired width.

So one evening I was over at my parents house after the sun went down and I saw all the lights she had in the backyard light up!  WOW, it was so beautiful!  It was at that moment that I decided I wanted to get solar lights for my backyard!  I found these and was so excited that I ordered them right away.  Initially I was attracted to the flowers on and then I also liked the various colors of the lights.  When the lights arrived I liked the fact the lights have a solar pack and on that pack was a button that powered the flowers.  I pushed the button and all the lights came on and I pushed it again and the lights blinked.  I just fell in love with them!  I strung the lights through my jasmine bush next to the front wall and made sure the solar pad was attached to the wall and visible.

This 'nightlight' is designed to sense the relative humidity and temperaturein and calculate a dew point. The fan is activated through the sensor based on the dew point and will turn the fan off automatically when the fan is no longer needed. This reminds me of my Prius which works in a similar way with battery and gas usage going through a computer.\nStraight out of the mailbox, my husband and I scurried down to the bathroom figuring this would be at best a half hour job. No way. We removed the plastic fan cover, snapped in the sensor, and positioned the nightlight. Then we just replaced the fan cover.\nThis seems to be working as promised.

Sure gives you better placement options and versatility on light stands and trusses with the drilled mounting holes. You can better fill in or evenly distribute fixtures.

This is great for me as I sometimes use a whole truss system and other times I just use the stands with T-bars and side arms. Putting in a longer bolt allows me to bolt 2 of these clamps to the tops of each T-bar so I can keep fixtures on the T-bars for use on stands or I can clamp the T-bars to the truss without having to unmount and remount each individual fixture.

It's tedious but once you find an efficient strategy, it gets easier and faster.\n\nSome problems I ran into:\n\n1.  The machine screws that came in the box were too long.  I ended up using 1.25\" screws instead of the included 1.5\" screws.  If you run into this problem, you can either use shorter screws or use standard 8-32 nuts instead of the cap nuts that come in the box.  The nuts will not be visible so I don't know why cap nuts are even included.\n\n2.  The 1.5\" machine screws included in the box seemed to be a non-standard thread as the standard 8-32 nuts I had didn't smoothly fit in them.  This resulted in some stripped threads but I used different screws anyway so it wasn't a big deal.\n\n3.  The instructions are nearly useless.\n\n4.  The bulbs are partially visible which may be harsh on the eyes.\n\n5.  The plastic wrap (used for protection) that surrounds the upper band of pendants can be difficult to take off completely since some of it is sandwiched between metal parts.\n\nEven with these problems, the fixture is very nice so I rate it between a 3.5 and 4.", "summary": "Beautiful fixture with some flaws and annoyances", "unixReviewTime": 1442188800}

That would be great, but I don't live by a sears, as they seem to be vanishing into thin air, so even if I bought craftsman I couldn't just go out and pick the part up anyways.\n\nThe sockets are well organized, and the gold labels make them really easy to identify. You've got a full set if 1/4 and 3/8 sockets, and you've got shallow and deep sockets in both sizes. You also get a set of wrenches, not too many sizes but they can be useful. The ratchets themselves seem very sturdy, along with the sockets. The 1/4 ratchet is great for times when you're limited on space or have a part that shouldn't be torqued too much.\n\nI've got one thing I don't like, I would've liked BOTH sides of the case to have a snug fit on the sockets. The case is meant to be opened logo up, if you open it the other way the sockets will fall out.\n\nOverall, if you need a sort of \"mechanics\" set of sockets and ratchets, this is a great set.", "summary": "Nice tool set for the casual mechanic and do-it-yourself-er.", "unixReviewTime": 1295740800}

This produces lower than the design load and can increase service life.\n\nThe box of bulbs I received actually contined 25 bulbs, five rows in each direction.

Where to begin?\nThey are really only suitable for new construction. Other reviews have suggested that they are difficult to retrofit, but in fact, they CANNOT be properly installed at all unless it is done before the finish ceiling is installed around them.  It doesn't matter if you have attic access.  For proper install they must go in before the drywall because the various flanges prevent the fan from fitting through it's own hole!  Why would they do this?  It would have been so easy to design them otherwise.  It's very similar to the oversight with the knock-outs for wire strain relief, also noted by others -- if proper strain relief is installed in the top knock-out, the hatch cannot be closed.  Baffling!\nAnd a few other issues to note: They're not that quiet; the listing claims the noise level is 0.6 sones, but mine are marked 0.8 sones, and even then they seem quite a bit louder than that, even before I've hooked up the duct.  The mounting flanges require a minimum 2x6 inch joist, won't work with a 2x4.  At the same time, if you opt for the adjustable mounting brackets instead, they are set so low in the housing that your finish ceiling can be a maximum of only 1/2 inch -- thicker drywall or planks or such are too thick.\nCONCLUSION: this is a decent fan for the price but with some very specific mounting requirements for NEW construction only.", "summary": "Crazy Mounting Problems", "unixReviewTime": 1491868800}

I ordered it to use in my infant's bedroom and it is perfect.  When I need to go into the nursery in the middle of the night to change or feed her, I try to avoid bright lights that would bring her to an alert state so I was looking for something with a softer, red-based tone to avoid the blue light that is emitted from cell phones and computer screens.  Although the bulb that this light comes with is clear, I feel the Himalayan salt cover is a softer glow and I like the health benefits that Himalayan salt lamps provide.  The particular salt cover that my light came with isn't all that red, but it casts is nice and gentle light in the room.  The light itself is very high quality, as well.  I am impressed with the construction, the way it fits together, and it looks great in the room.  It's well made and the only thing that I would like even more is if it came with a dimmer switch or an adjustment switch to toggle between low, mid, and bright light.  It is quite heavy when put together, but the salt cover fits snugly on the base with a rubber-based fitting so I am not concerned that it will fall apart or break if bumped.  I also like the feature it has where it can be positioned horizontally or vertically.  The Himalayan salt cover measures 2 1/2\" long and 2\" in diameter.  I am including a few pictures so you can see the assembly and get an idea of how bright the light is in a dark room.

Every review I read or came across, had nothing but fantastic things to say about this fantastic flashlight.  PD35 TAC Flashlight was mentioned in every review I read, or watched online. When compared to other brands even the negatives noted were not serious, and the \"flashlight shined on in my mind\".  I received the PD35 TAC this morning, (one day shipping and it was at my door at 7:00am - thank you Amazon!!), along with a Fenix AOF-S+ RED Filter, and the AOD-S Diffuser Tip. All items were exactly as described, and in perfect condition. This is not my first tactical light, and ordered it without the 18650 battery included, so first time buyers beware, you will need a battery and a charger for the 18650 cell. The nice part is that it will also function with two (2) CR-123 lithium cells that are easy to purchase at most stores that sell batteries, including your local quick store in the neighborhood, Wally World and many others.\n\nPutting a charged 18650 into the unit, I was amazed.  The factory default setting is the Tactical mode which only allows the rear tail switch to operate the unit in three modes. Turbo 1000 Lumens, Low 80 Lumens, and a very aggressive disorienting Strobe at 1000 Lumens.  It was very intuitive to half press the tail switch and switch between the modes, and then be able to choose the setting you want in a very short learning curve time frame.  For my everyday carry needs I will keep the  PD35 TAC Flashlight  in the Tactical mode, giving me the true functionality I was looking for in the first place.  Evening's in the wood or on the lake I will switch to the Outdoor mode which is quite simple.  With the PD35 TAC Flashlight in Turbo 1000 Lumens, press and hold the stainless steel side button until the strobe function starts and then in about 2 seconds the light will flash two (2) times. when that occurs you are now in Outdoor mode and have 5 brightness levels to choose from or cycle through as well as the strobe function.  The rear tail switch will turn the PD35 TAC Flashlight on and off, and retain the setting that you leave it in when you turn the light back on.  No need to cycle through all of the brightness settings again and again.  Getting back to the Tactical mode is as simple as holding the side button in for two seconds or so with the light on, and allowing the light to flash two (2) times again.  You are now back in the Tactical mode, and only tail switch operations are recognized.  Truly a great light, that I feel will last many years, and seems to be built tough and trouble fee, ( 5 Year Warranty from Fenix). The PD35 TAC Flashlight came with a nylon belt holster, wrist lanyard, spare o ring, and a replacement rubber tail switch cover.\n\nI am already planning my next Fenix  PD35 TAC Flashlight purchase, this time along with the Fenix AER01/02 remote pressure switch, and the Fenix ALG rail mount to attach the  PD35 TAC to my hunting rifle.  I will have to keep testing the light for the next few weeks to see how its performance holds up in real life situations outside of the house.", "summary": "Impressive  PD35 TAC Flashlight right out of the box !!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

I don't really use it all that often but when I do, I am impressed with its power and smoothness.  I initially got it with a 55\" guide rail and in combination, they work very well.  I've just ordered another 55\" rail and the Festool connector so I'll be able to rip panels into more manageable pieces (I've got a small shop and a small table saw).  Even though it takes a little time to set things up, the tool leaves a fine, splinter-free cut that makes it worth it.  I have yet to try all the things the saw might be capable of but I'm confident that it will do them as well as the right angle crosscuts.  As others have mentioned, the cord is a little short and the vacuum port does swivel (something that can probably be easily corrected) but they are minor issues.

To connect the light to the 120 line requires more time because the wire from the transformer is so short. This complicates what should / could be much easier if the wire was just a couple of inches longer.\nTypically recessed lighting units come with a junction box attached for the electrical connection.  This unit does not and it complicates the installation.\nPersonally, I would like to see the light sold with the transformer sold separately.

I'm not going to get long-winded as I basically agree with 95% of the detailed info already posted on this great product. I will give you a few personal impressions.... It is razor sharp and made of a great/reliable and easy to sharpen steel.  I have not had to touch up the edge yet. I prefer the non-serrated blades although I have a few that are in my EDC collection.  My tastes include Spyderco, Kershaw, Gerber, Camillus, Ontario and Ka Bar mostly.  I look for blades that are an outstanding value overall and can do so with out spending $100.  I buy blades for a specific purpose/use.  This is a stout blade, a true working knife!  It is a bit heavy for summer EDC, but with heavy work clothes [construction trade] or with jeans in the winter/cooler months it is not a problem.  It is a good camp, pack, field unit or a handy blade to keep in your glove or tool box as long as you don't get pulled over in one of those \"anti-everything\" states/towns [i.e. the socialist town known as Chicago].  Drilled out liners would save a bit of weight.  But this weight also helps with balance and follow-through when cutting.  I paid about $26 shipped from another vender.  Hopefully Amazon will offer it again so more folks can buy this great value.

Ross", "reviewText": "Great bulbs:  OK price, great color temperature (match tungsten very well), good size for convention lamp sockets.  I'm using one of these and three LE 12W LED bulbs in a four-light Kitchen ceiling application where they face downward and replace four 100W conventional tungsten incandescent bulbs.  I inserted the LED bulbs one at a time to see how their light compared with the conventional 100W bulbs that they replaced.  To my surprise both the Muller and LE 12W LEDs match the 100W tunsten bulbs very well both in color and in brightness...in fact my wife and I think the LEDs appear a bit brighter than the 100 W tungsten bulbs they replace in this application.  In this application we've replaced 400W of tungsten bulbs with 48W of LEDs...a great saving, as it seems our kitchen lights are always on.\n\nIn separate engineering tests that I ran on the bulbs, I found that if you have an application that uses the light off the back side of the bulb (like an application with a rear reflector or a desk lamp where the bulb is facing up) then these bulbs are probably closer to matching conventional 60 or 75 watt bulbs.  Note that the Muller bulbs ARE dimmable...as is stated by the manufacturer, and we found that they dim very nicely with our conventional wall dimmer switch.  If you DON'T need dimmable bulbs, I found that the 12 Watt (75W) Warm White LED bulbs by LE were essentially identical to these Muller bulbs, BUT were much much less expensive.  I tried them side by side in our kitchen application and in my engineering tests.\n\nIn another test I'm using these Muller bulbs in an application with an on/off timer wired in series with the bulbs.  With conventional tungsten bulbs, the tungsten filament conducts electricity all the time to keep this timer powered even when the bulb is turned off.  This Muller LED performs the same function as it passes a low current even when it is turned off by the timer...in fact the bulb remains with a very very low glow when turned off by the timer (kind of like a weak night light).  So far the timer seems to be working normally, and the LED lights fully with the timer turns it on.  We'll see how it performs in the long run...if it works it's a great solution to our timer-light problem.  In the past we've been stuck with using incandescent bulbs with the timers as we really like the timer that simultaneously works as an real-time on-off switch when we want it and as a timer turning on the lights on and off when we're not at home.", "summary": "Great Dimmable LED bulbs for home Applications", "unixReviewTime": 1433548800}

This could improve as CRKT knives seem to grow on me as I use them.  I hope this one does as well. I want to love this knife -I'm a huge Ruger affectionado (SR45 & an LC9 are my bang bang EDC's) but my first impression is it's going to be a good friend but not a lover affair.\n\nIndeed this is a big imposing folder.  Distinctive styling with the handle obviously designed to echo the picatinny rail used to mount scopes, sights or lasers on Ruger firearms.  Very clever.\n\nThe aluminum handle is robust but damn heavy. The center of balance is about a third of the way down the handle which has the effect of making the blade feel light but the overall package is again hefty...even heavier then my Espada large (see pics). Not a complaint but rather an observation. A plus is the weight make the butt of the handle a very effective blunt force weapon.\n\nThe blade is a thick serious slab of steel at 4.8 mm (compared to the cold steel Recons or Voyagers at 4mm) and it looks great. The stonewash finish is impeccable.  The shape is a drop point-ish spear point-ish hollow ground beauty.\n\nThe liner lock is confusing.  I'm sure CRKT knows what's it's doing but a liner lock for such a heavy blade just seems...well...a dainty choice. A knife this large should be able to take a big beating and liner locks just don't have the durability of a frame lock.  Simple physics. Conversely...and perhaps a rational...a liner lock does not snap shut once past the dentent like a frame lock does, so it does make that BIG blade bit safer to close for the less attentive (hand raised, as I've been seriously bitten and bloodied by the aggressive detent on a CS Voyager XL - I now have 9 1/2 fingerprints as a result) Risk vs reward I guess.  The liner lock itself is thick steel so I'm sure there are no worries when flicking.  Right CRKT?  I do like my10 fingers....\n\nThis death infictor does not use a pocket clip, which make sense considering the heft.  Rather, it has a nice codura sheath ( see pics).  I mount this upside down for quick deployment.  A knife this size, for me, is purely a self defense device and I carry it with that in mind.\n\nBlade is razor sharp.  Thumbs posts are the size of large pushpins and as such make flipping open flippin' easy.\n\nThis knife is at a size and price point that bumps it into some very capable competition.  I think it will sell well with Ruger fans, less well with others.  I think the liner lock was a bad choice for this knife at this size though probably a good liability choice.  Should you buy it?  I think it will become a collector piece eventually especially for GUN collectors but as a tool I'm not sure.  I want to love you Go-N-Heavy.  You got a pretty face with a goofy Tony Soprano-esq name, but alas you may be answering a question that I'm not asking.\n\nTime will tell.\n\nAs Reviewed by Yitzhak \"Rabbi Steel\" HaLevy", "summary": "FINALLY, a good quality mega folder that's NOT made by Cold Steel", "unixReviewTime": 1467158400}

I'm sure my neighbors heard it a quarter mile away. So you better have a big solid honking router to handle it and you better be a man or at least a woman with some spiritual cojones.\n\nI consider myself a fairly advanced woodworker... I've made a lot of cabinets... and some furniture like kitchen carts and coffee tables... hard maple... but I wouldn't say heirloom furniture just quite yet... I don't have a permanent shop, just my garage, so I guess I'm a weekend warrior that way. I'm sharing this just so you can compare your level to mine.\n\nAnyway, I used this bit in my Bosch router mounted on my Bosch router table to cut lock miter joints for 7 newel posts made of 1\" thick red oak...52\" long...lots of joints! That isn't a nominal thickness, the actual true thickness is 1\" and red oak is pretty hard and can be prone to being a little brittle as well when being cut so I consider this a good test. There are definitely harder woods, but I wasn't joining pine.\n\nThis was my first time using a lock miter bit and I think it has gone well. The joints fit without forcing and close tightly. I glued one this afternoon... will report back if it's not perfect but it looks pretty good from what I can see so far.\n\nThe wood was purchased rough sawn. I ran it through a thickness planer to get it down to my desired thickness, then cut to oversize length for the newel posts, then hit each piece with a jointer on one edge to get one nice straight square edge. Then cut to width on a table saw. Then the router comes in...\n\nRegarding setup, I advise first time users (like me) to visit youtube and watch several different videos. Different people have different techniques. Setup blocks wouldn't work for me because of my stock thickness being non standard. The setup jigs seem to be made for 3/4 or 1/2 stock. I think even if you used a setup block you'd still be well advised to make test cuts to prove it's right. I just made cuts until it was right, making very small adjustments to height and depth until the joint was right. I'm planning to burnish or hit it with a small radius roundover to finish the edge anyway.. Once you get it right, DON'T MOVE THE DEPTH SETTING and don't move the fence until you mark the final position carefully so you can get back to it!\n\nThat said, I marked the fence position and then adjusted for a shallower depth of cut. I first tried about half depth, but had a lot of chatter. This bit chops out big hunks of wood and my shop vac wasn't clearing them from the cut zone very well so they were getting pulled back into the cutting bit and causing havoc!! I ended up making the miters in 4 passes. Yes, more time, but no chatter and nice smooth cuts. Trust me, you don't want ripple cuts! Easy does it. I found that having the shop vac at the top vacuum outlet helped to keep the cut zone clear, but the vast majority of the chips went DOWN inside the router table base. I had to clean it out every 6 cuts. That's more because of my router table than this bit, so no stars lost.\n\nAfter each pass I moved the fence back a little. The final cut was about 1/8\" of fence, which was pretty light. I wanted it that way to ensure a nice smooth finish cut. Try to make that finish cut in one smooth pass. Making a double pass will take off more than you want... don't do that. I tried it. I know. One smooth careful final pass. Perfecto!\n\nAfter 7 newel posts in red oak, 52\" long, 8 edges per post, 4 passes per edge... that's 7 x 4 x 8 x 52\" = 11648\" of cut... or 971 feet... nearly 0.2 miles... geez, I didn't realize it was that much! Anyway, the finalfinish cuts are smooth. Fast. Neato!\n\nGood bit!\n\nBravo Freud!", "summary": "Excellent bit; BIG and AGGRESSIVE but setup not so complicated", "unixReviewTime": 1414886400}

I used it on two smart light switches by Wemo. It fitted well. Smart wifi light switches generate some heat. The metallic cover would help to dissipate some of the heat. Furthermore, I was able to trigger lights remotely using Wemo or IFTTT app on my cell . Wemo light switch manufacturer does not recommend using metallic wall switch cover due to absorption of wifi signals. However, it worked well for me. This was probably because my modem/router was pretty close to the metallic wall cover.", "summary": "Well made and excellent quality", "unixReviewTime": 1514332800}

I ended up wrapping it with aluminum foil and tape instead of using a paint tray liner.\n\nAs a tray this might be usable with a 7-inch roller but if you are using a 9-inch it isn't comfortably wide enough with some frames (like the Wooster Brush R017-9, the roller is a tight fit) and isn't deep enough and i find myself manually using a brush a lot to apply the paint onto the roller.\n\nMy next paint tray would be meant for 11-inch rollers and deeper.", "summary": "Gimmick - pass, get a wider and deeper one.", "unixReviewTime": 1389484800}
