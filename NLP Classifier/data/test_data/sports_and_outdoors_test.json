The SERPA had been getting bad press for ADs when pressing the button and briskly drawing the weapon in combat situations.  Hence, I went with the Fobus to eliminate the risk of an AD.  It holds the weapon firmly, and works well in concealment.  Unlike the SERPA that requires a button push, however, the Fobus requires a brisk draw by pulling the weapon straight up, to unlock the clamp that holds it in the holster.  This sounds good, right?  Here's the catch - and I thankfully learned it in training.  Otherwise, my friends, I'd be dead now.\nIn today's training (I am a full time LEO), we got knocked off a bicycle and had to draw and fire at multiple assailants while lying weak side down.  Guess what?  I could not draw the weapon because while laying down, I was not able to pull the weapon straight up in a brisk pull.  After a few frantic seconds and some really powerful yanks, I got it out and engaged the targets.  But, that was pretending to be knocked down and laying on the ground.  Would I have been able to keep my cool and get the weapon out if someone had really punched me, or worse?  I don't think so.  I am -- after writing this review -- actually here on AMZN to purchase a new holster.  Upshot - if you plan to be standing, great, this holster will work.  If you plan to carry your weapon with you everywhere, don't get this holster.  If you get knocked down, or for that matter, if you get down for cover, I can now confirm that you may not be able to draw the weapon.

Use it as a last defense against roadside attacks.\n- It's 16oz, a perfect size.\n- It's a nice shape to hold in your hand.\n- It looks nice.\n- This cup will outlast your car, every coffee machine you own, your life, your children's life, and very likely, all of humankind.\n- When all has faded to dust, there will still be a Thermos King 16oz cup, half buried in sand, paint eroded away, with lukewarm 7/11 coffee inside.\n- You can easily take apart the lid to clean the internals where coffee residue or flavors might start to build up.\n- The Thermos logo fell long ago, it was just glued on.\n- Like most people, the paint on mine started to come off. Embrace it -- it's a sign of pride for how long you've owned it. You really want it to look like your cup is brand new all the time? No! After a few years I discovered the black paint can be scraped off with a mesh metal kitchen scrubber. With some elbow grease, I scraped off all the paint to have a beautiful chrome mug of bare steel reborn. Like Gandalf the White. Or a snake shedding its skin. Or a butterfly born from the chrysalis. Or a phoenix rising from the ashes.\n\nSeriously. Invest in your future. Buy this mug.", "summary": "The best mug ever", "unixReviewTime": 1456704000}

Utilized my own which made it easier. My wife loved the elliptical bike and had been using it twice a day. On 2-2-16, I contacted Best Choice Products customer service about the fan wheel starting to wobble. Found that the right side where the chain sprocket is attached had exceptional wear on the plastic part of the fan wheel which caused the wobbling. This is a pre-assembled part of the elliptical bike and I was attempting to get a replacement part. I was advised by customer service that the warranty was only for 60 days but the customer service representative stated she would contact a supervisor concerning the part. On 2-3-16, customer service advised me that a replacement part would be sent and should arrive within 5-7 days. On 2-5-16, we received a replacement elliptical bike. Awesome and professional customer service from Best Choice Products. They are not the manufacturer of this product, it is made in China. However, for a company selling the product, outstanding customer service. Thank You Best Choice Products.\n\nMay 2016 Update; The replacement Elliptical Bike was delivered on 2-5-16 and was non-functioning by 5-6-16. Same issue as the first. A big design flaw with the plastic wheel which can not take the strain and/or use with the metal parts, specifically the drive sprocket. The metal \"axle\" which runs through the center of the plastic wheel requires a fixed metal sleeve so as not to excessively wear out the plastic wheel which causes the wobbling and ultimately renders the Elliptical Bike useless. Changed to one star for the product. Moved on to a major brand and spent the money hoping for better results", "summary": "Great Customer Service, but BAD product.", "unixReviewTime": 1454803200}

The stock seat is not comfortable after more that 20 minutes.\n\nI have an old profile design seat on my MTB that has a similar cut out and I like it. I figured I would give this one a chance, it is reasonably priced and it is similar to the type of saddle I have had good luck with before.  The seat is an INSTANT improvement over the stock saddle.\n\nThis saddle works great, very comfortable. The longest I have ridden for so far is just over 1 hour (23 miles) no numbness or serious discomfort at all.\n\n I can ride for up to 40 minutes without padded bike shorts just wearing my running shorts with zero problems as well.\n\nI will find out if this will work for longer distances (time) over the upcoming winter on the trainer.\n\nThe seat has plenty of forward and aft adjustment to fine tune your bike position.\n\nI 100% recommend it.\n\nUPDATE,  I just did a 51 mile ride in a tough route. Hilly, wind and reasonably fast 2 hours and 48 minutes.  Not as comfortable as sitting on the couch to be sure and I was glad to get off the bike BUT very doable and a HUGE improvement over the previous saddle.\n\nUPDATE... I have switched to an Adamo ISM Racing II.  After several adjustments over about 100 miles of riding I am now a believer in the Adamo.  THAT SAID the Adamo costs 3X as much and is about twice as good. Figure it out for yourself if it is worth it.  ALSO, I find the Adamo very comfortable in the aero position BUT less than great in the upright position.  So to conclude the Adamo is what I will probably stick with for triathlon.

Not a huge deal for some since if you tip it slowly the lid is designed to funnel liquid to the lowest point just fine (but I don't always do that). My fix - I put some tape (reflective tape seems to stick the best) at the 9 and 3 o'clock positions when the vents are at 12 and 6. No more guessing.\n\n2. Design is sleek and smooth which is comfortable to hold but does end up sliding out of the side pockets on my backpack occasionally (resulting in much of the harsh treatment I've put it through). A quick wrap with a bike tube or some rubber bands might fix this but wouldn't be as nice to hold.\n\n3. Seal button can be deceiving. Steam pressure can build up inside pushing the button up to show as sealed when it's not. After bending over to get things with my backpack on and pouring hot tea down my side a few times I've just learned to double check this. Yeah, it took me more than once. Don't laugh.

I appreciated that all the small parts are shrink-wrapped onto a labeled card; it made it easy to find them.  Don't just rip that apart; open them as you need them.  In addition to the included hex wrenches, you'll need at the minimum a crescent wrench, a box cutter, and a mallet to put this together; you may also want a ratcheted socket wrench (13/16\") to speed things up, and a side cutter to cut the zipties.  Don't be afraid to pound with the mallet; this is a tensegrity construction and so the parts don't always line up perfectly.\n\nAs a weight bench, the bar catches are easy to move, the backboard is wide enough and reasonably padded, and its surface is a nice faux leather vinyl.  The bar catches are closer together than the usual bench but as long as you stay aligned there's no concern with a 7\" Olympic bar.  I don't max out; if I did, I would want a more forgiving type of bench that had the bar catches further apart in case my form started to wobble.\n\nI don't see much use for the leg unit.  The plastic ends that hold the rubber cushions on are sharp and have to be hammered into place with a mallet, and they still don't hold the cushions very stable.  The axle is an ill fit, lists off to one side, and you can't put much weight on it, so I think it is more a novelty item.  The side catches hold my 170 lbs of weights no problem, and I don't think I'll be having any trouble using all that weight plus my 200 lb body on this bench, although the vague sticker notes a '300 lb limit'.\n\nI'm getting back into lifting after a 25 year hiatus, and I am hoping to get a year or so out of this bench 3 times a week, at which point hopefully I'll have the self-esteem to walk into a real gym and move my workouts there.  I think if you're looking for heavier use - maxing out, or 225 lb sets, or a real leg machine, or a 5 year investment - you might be better served to look for a sturdier unit.", "summary": "Entry level compact barbell bench", "unixReviewTime": 1451865600}

We all know that a good ski jacket isn't cheap, especially for brands like Arcteryx, Marmot, Mountain Hardware, Patagonia, or mid-price range brands like the North Face. If you're out on the mountain a lot during winter time, or hike during summer time, the Nikwax is a must to help keep the jacket/pants look like new. I'm not going to explain how waterproof jacket works, you can read it here ( www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/rainwear-how-it-works.html), but essentially, you CAN'T use regular detergents to wash your waterproof outwear or else you'll ruin the DWR layer that help prevent the water from getting in.\n\nThis Duo-pack comes with 2 different bottles. And I'll briefly summarize the different usages.\n\nTech wash - This is the first one to use in washing your outerwear. It cleans the dirt that's blocking the tiny pores on the surface of the outerwear so that it revives the breathability (so excessive heat can escape). It claims to add water repellency back to the outerwear as well, meaning renewing the layer of DWR, but not enough to restore the waterproofness back to optimal conditon.\n\nT.X. Direct - this is where you need to perform the second step after the Tech wash. Essentially T.X. Direct contains mostly DWR material to further waterproof your washed outerwear. And that's why this pack comes with 2 different bottles to completely wash and renew your outerwear.\n\n**interesting fact**\nIf your something like a backpack, and it doesn't have waterproof ability, you can wash it first (with regular detergent or Tech wash), and then use T.X. Direct. It will help repel light rain. It's useful if you hike in the summer and encounter light rain. If you want an easier way, you can also try the spray version (http://www.amazon.com/Nikwax-Fabric-Leather-Spray-On-Waterproofing/dp/B0028EFBLY/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1449154066&sr=1-1&nodeID=7141123011)", "summary": "A must have for ski/snowboard jackets or pants", "unixReviewTime": 1449100800}

With that said, I was not compensated in any way for this review, and no promises were made that I would either review this product, or review it positively after receiving it. Please see my profile for more info.\n\nProduct:Simply Simily Stainless Steel Water Bottle\n\nGeneral Impressions: This is a nice looking product that has an attractive wave logo and message about recycling. Not too long ago many people started carrying around plastic bottles, which now seem to be the way most Americans get their water. Plastic is harmful to the environment, probably to the people drinking the water, and bottled water is many times more expensive than tap water. In the US nearly everywhere tap water is as good or better than bottled water. To improve the taste I have been using a Brita pitcher with a carbon filter for our already good tap water. This bottle is the perfect companion for a Brita or similar pitcher. I have also always liked the way water tastes in a stainless steel container, I am not totally sure if there is a difference or this is my imagination (probably the later).\n\nQuality of Product: This is a stainless steel water bottle with a plastic cap. I have used similar bottles for sometime. The cap fits tightly and the product appears well made. It is NOT insulated, so even though you could put something hot in it, I wouldnt do it.\n\nIssues: The bottle comes with a small piece of paper warning about putting hot liquids in and being careful if you choose to. While this doesnt surprise me, I just wished people had more common sense than to put boiling liquid into an uninsulated metal container. But I am sure someone has done that more than once.\n\nComparisons to Other Products: I have seen other similar bottles before, and I think that the logo is a nice touch to distinguish this product. The bottle and cap are very much like other similar products I have seen in both quality and appearance.\n\nPros:\n-Nice quality\n-Distinctive logo\n-Way cheaper to fill up your own water bottle than to use plastic bottles that are expensive and destructive to the environment.\n\nCons:\n-It isn't insulated?\n-Nothing else really", "summary": "Nice stainless bottle so you can stop using plastic water bottles!", "unixReviewTime": 1427760000}

It looks good and appears to be well made. The size is adequate for day trips; as shown in the photo, the top is expandable. There are also a variety of helpful side compartments.

It also has reflective markings, and comes with a shoulder strap that can be detached.\n\nThe only downside is that I like to park and take my bike bag into restaurants or stores; because it uses Velcro straps, it is a slight inconvenience to have to un-do and re-do those each time.

I wear these sleeves whenever I'm doing heavy, short sets (3-5 reps of body weight or higher).  I do not wear them for most activity as they do constrain your mobility.  I think they would be somewhat uncomfortable for long-duration activities like running where a knee brace might be more appropriate than a sleeve.\n\nI am 5'2\", 120lbs and ordered a small.  They are tight to get on, but definitely put the right pressure on your knee cap so you feel incredibly stable. They are very hard to get on once you're sweaty, so I would recommend putting them on, then flipping them inside out while you warm up (just roll them inside out and let them rest of your calves).

Cranford", "reviewText": "I bought this revolver as a marksmanship training device.  This resembles the Colt Python or Diamondback revolver except for being single action (you must cock the hammer for each shot).  It takes three times the training time and twice the ammuntion to achieve proficiency with the double-action revolver as it does with the semi-automatic handgun and revolver shooters require more refresher training.  I've only owned and fired two Colt double-action revolvers--the rest have been Smith and Wessons or clones of Smith and Wesson.  So the cylinder rotates \"backwards\" and I cannot get the feel of the double-action trigger.  There is also the durability issue--this revolver is too flimsy for dynamic tactical training.\n\nHowever, as a safer alternative training device to a live revolver for handling and basic marksmanship this works well.  It feels good in the hand, if about a quarter the weight of the real revolver.  Trigger pull is short and light--not up to the Colt standards, but adequate for training. I'd place the target no more than ten feet from the shooter and five feet isn't too close.  Wear your safety goggles (not included).  Firing signature is low.  For shooting at moving targets, the low velocity brightly-colored 6mm pellet acts like a tracer bullet in good light.  Being able to fire indoors without a special range and being able to reuse ammunition keeps practice costs low as you master sight alignment and trigger control.  The seperate cartriges are nice for training in revolver handling and loading/unloading exercises.  The cartridges are easy to load, but rough handling will cause the 6mm pellets to fall out.  I ordered an additional package of cartridges so that I could practice reloading.  The pistol lacks durability for dynamic drills, but for a beginner who practices smoothly performing every action perfectly, it works very well.\n\nI commend the adjustable sights--they work like the originals--but be careful to GENTLY adjust the sights.\n\nI was looking for an inexpensive training revolver that I didn't need a formal firearms range for safe practice.  I cannot fire combat drills with this revolver, but I do have a device that permits me to safely shoot indoors at 10 feet and practice sight alignment and trigger control.  I have to load without using a speed loader (can't find one that fits) but that works for the beginner, too.", "summary": "Colt Revolver Replica for Marksmanship Training", "unixReviewTime": 1278633600}

If you're interested in that role and history just search for \"MACV-SOG knife\" on the web.  I had purchased an inexpensive knockoff of this knife which got me interested in learning more about this historic knife. The more I learned the more I knew I had to have this knife. I know the actual knives varied somewhat over the years, but this SOG S1T-L Bowie 2.0 knife was designed and crafted to accurately represent the appearance and salient features of the original MACV-SOG knife and its successors. Of course over the decades better materials, a titanium coating and advanced manufacturing have contributed to a knife much improved from the 1960's while retaining the uniqueness and qualities of the original.\n\nThis knife is very well made. The unique blade is perfectly ground, shaped, polished and sharpened. It is beautifully coated in black titanium nitride (TiNi) as are the cross guard and the butt cap. The handle is made of leather washers slotted and stacked along the blade tang. They are shaped to provide a smooth finish and flat finger grooves along the bottom. The handle is oval shaped and is said to be epoxy coated. There is a hole in the butt cap for a lanyard.\n\nThe sheath is well made of high quality leather dyed black and follows the pattern of the original SOG knife sheath with a small pouch on the front that includes a sharpening stone. The retention strap wraps around the top of the cross guard and snaps to the front.\n\nI have only two minor complaints The handle is quite slippery. The finger grooves are helpful, but not quite enough. Also, there is a rivet through the lower portion of the belt loop that attaches the retention strap. As the blade is slid into the sheath the cross guard can slide along the rivet cap which can put a scratch in the cross guard. This can be avoided if the belt loop is pulled back while inserting the blade in the sheath, however, this isn't practical if the sheath is on the belt. I like the knife enough overall to not mark it down for these issues. Carrying and using any knife will cause wear, so either keep it for show or use it and accept the wear. If you like knives, you'll like this one.", "summary": "This is a great knife.", "unixReviewTime": 1460073600}

I waited for Armalaser to release the TR4 before buying a laser because I really like the way it activates by skin contact without any buttons to push.  Now that I have used it, I really like it.  I am glad I waited.\n\nIt fits well on my S&W Shield.  I am new at shooting, but fairly handy with tools.  It took me about 20 to 30 minutes of carefully following the directions to complete the installation.  Now that it is done I realize I could have gone much more quickly, but I was afraid of breaking something.  The FFL who delivered my pistol asked to look at the installation.  His comment: \"Looks factory installed.\"\n\nI took it to a range to test how well it was sighted in.  I test fired groups at 5, 7, 10, and 25 yards, using bean bags to steady and brace each shot.  At the close in, personal defense ranges [5, 7, and 10 yards] my groups were about 2 to 3 inches high, but right on the center line.  I am not surprised because the factory says it is adjusted before shipping for a longer distance.  I plan to re-adjust the aim, probably for 10 yards, on my next trip to the range.  At 25 yards, my groups were awful, but that is not the laser's fault, it is just I am not a good shot at that distance.  I can barely see the target.\n\nThe only downside at this point is that the TR4 is still so new that I cannot find any fitted holster for my pistol with the laser installed.  Armalaser has told me they are working with a manufacturer and will email me when they have it set up.  I talked with the president of Comfort-Tuk yesterday and learned he is trying to get a model to send to his mold maker so he can make a holster to fit.  But for now all I can use are generic, non-formed holsters.  The \"UTG Ambidextrous Pocket Holster (Small, 3.9-Inch, Black),\" available here on Amazon, the BlackHawk size 7 IWB from a local store, the \"AMBIDEXTROUS INSIDE THE PANTS HOLSTER\" from holsterman6376 on EBAY, and the \"Leather Concealment Gun Holster - M&P SHIELD with or without Laser (#035)\" from Holstermonster, also on EBAY, all work, well enough for now.  But I can't wait for a good quality formed holster for concealed carry to be manufactured.\n\nThis laser is a great addition to the S&W Shield.  Just keep in mind that finding a proper holster is going to be difficult until enough of them are out there for the manufacturers to respond to market demand.", "summary": "Love the laser, wishing for a kydex or formed leather holster.", "unixReviewTime": 1426377600}

That oftentimes happens to me as I'm commuting, and I want to be certain I'm seen, lest I become a hood ornament! I just recently started getting other lights, (since I saw how big of an impact these were making, as far as visibility) and will let you know how that goes. HOWEVER, these lights are VERY easy to install, and the only actual 'tool' I used, was the\nclippers to cut the zip ties when I was done! They're even bright enough to be used during the day, albeit they're not as effective. Still, as I said before, they're easy to install, one charge lasts QUITE a while, and they do a great job at keeping you seen (night or day), so get a set! You'll be happy you did!\n\n(UPDATE 6/14/2015:) Just a word of advice to all the present and future owners of this product. It IS very bright and noticeable, one thing though. Even though the light lasts a quite a while, if you don't charge it every night after a ride, (like I forgot to) and the battery dies on you, once you DO charge it again, it won't work. Calm down! I know the problem! I (at first) thought it was the battery in the 'dashboard' (controller). What it REALLY is, is that if the battery dies, you lose the 'pairing' you did when you first installed the product on your bike. What you need to do, is 're-pair' the two again. Just check the instruction leaflet (that's all it needs, and I like that, plain and simple) that came with it. If you lost/misplaced it, here are the directions, straight from the leaflet itself: \"To Pair Dashboard with Battery\" 1)Press and hold the battery box button for 3 seconds 2)Then press any button on the dashboard. Hope this helps! I'm also going to make sure I charge it after every ride from now on, no sense taking chances!\n\n(UPDATE 6-19-2017)\nWell, after about 2 years, the lights are still going, but unfortunately, The wire from the battery (even though I ride a road bike, but in some rougher areas sometimes) wore out and frayed. Though I didn't think they would, (especially after all this time) I decided to ask for a new power wire, and how much they would want. They pleasantly surprised me when they e-mailed me THE NEXT DAY, and told me they would send me a replacement AT NO CHARGE! THAT'S customer service!!!! I wonder what else this company has for sale....?", "summary": "These are great for getting you noticed, and therefore, not accidentally bumped off the road!", "unixReviewTime": 1433116800}

Labeled as an XB-300li, it was sold by the manufacturer at $599, with free shipping. I attempted to buy one locally, with dealer support, and was quoted $1299 plus sales tax, and was told it wasn't a very good bike, and I should avoid it and buy something better (and for much more money). Having read many reviews, I knew there was a risk, but for 599, with free shipping and no local sales tax, decided to take it. I have no regrets.\n\nToday, the same bike is labeled as a Trail Maker, and sells direct for $749.00. I would say that's a good value, if you know what you're getting into.\n\nThe bad: the seat is unrideable, the grips are uncomfortable, and the entire bike is poorly built. All of these things are fixable, but need to be addressed.\n\nThe good: the frame is well-designed, incorporates the electrics quite nicely, and being the one thing that cannot be changed or upgraded, seems very well designed and built. It doesn't hurt that it's a good-looking piece of kit, much better than 90% of the other electric bikes on the market. And the frame itself (at least mine) was straight and true, beautifully welded, a bit heavy for aluminum, but a nice frame for all that.\n\nOut of the box, I trued and tensioned the badly built wheels, and avoided many problems. If you can't do that yourself, you need your local bike shop to do it--it's cheap insurance against issues. The saddle is awful; any decent bike saddle will be better. Plan on one. The handgrips are truly unbearable; my changeout to expensive German ergo grips changed the bike entirely, for the better.\n\nOne negative is the lack of sizes--one frame fits all. I'm 6'1\", and the crappy suspension seat post would go nowhere near high enough. Being a standard size (27.2) it was easily and cheaply replaced, with one very beneficial result. With the very high seat and long post, I can just barely pull the battery out without moving the seat. If you're 6' or less, plan on moving the seat every time you pull the battery. Having said that, with a bit longer stem, the bike, while a bit smallish frame for me, fits me quite well.\n\nI worked for a while with the original disc brakes, which weren't too bad. But when they needed new pads, and had issues, I elected to upgrade the disk brakes.\n\nThe original rear rack was a bit heavy; I left it off at first, but when I needed one, I put on something lighter, a Topeak MTX to mate with a rear set of panniers.\n\nSo, bike, with decent motor: $599 flat.\n\nUsed saddle: $35.\n\nSeat post: $20.00\n\nLonger stem: $25.00\n\nTires: $60.00 (wanted urban slicks, not off-road knobbies)\n\nBetter (lighter) rack: $75.00\n\nErgo grips: $25.00\n\nSo, for $840 cash, still almost $500 under what the local shop wanted for this self-same bike, I have an exceptionally competent urban warrior.\n\nX-treme tries to sell this as an off-road mountain bike. I wouldn't take this onto single-track, ever. But it's been a great urban warrior, for the better part of a year, that gets me to work everyday without breaking a sweat, and lets me ride 10 miles easily with no strain on a heart compromised by age and cardiac issues. It's a thrill to pass all the local college kids, when I'm really not working very hard. And a 15 mile round-trip, without a lot of effort, seems to leave me with plenty of battery reserve.\n\nI swore up-front I'd never love this bike, but in fact, I do. If you don't know bikes well, you might have issues, but if you do, this can be a revelation. Plan on not having any real support from the manufacturer, but if you're self-sufficient, this bike is an outstanding value.\n\nMaybe I got lucky, but I've been extremely pleased with this purchase.\n\nUpdate: 12/6/2016\n\nAfter 2 years of faithful service, the bike died a week ago, following riding it in torrential downpours. It's been fine in wet conditions, but these were exceptional. It appears that the incomplete sealing of the compartment for the controller (behind the bottom bracket) allowed water to corrode the controller. I've ordered a replacement (model # YK70B for those interested) and am hopeful that it will resolve the issue. But even if it doesn't, I'll feel that I've gotten my value out of this bicycle. Until this failure, it was unfailingly reliable every day for 2+ years. For the same money, I could've supported a car for about 3 months. So I remain happy with the purchase, and hopeful that I will return it to service for $90, for another couple of years.", "summary": "Good value, but not for neophytes.", "unixReviewTime": 1436745600}

They fit very loosely on your wrists and don't naturally conform to your palm/fingers, requiring adjustment between every set of reps.\n\n5.  Most of all: why?

The run time is awful, coming in at 90 minutes on high mode, this is 1 ride at night, so i find my self charging it every time that it is used. The light is very small and light weight, at the sacrifice of battery life. It does feel a little flimsy when installed on my seat post, but this is due to the mount being rubber, I do not have a concern of it falling off while riding however. I am not impressed with the brightness, and I feel this is far from 120 lumens. The instructions say \"caution: do not stare directly into beam\"... this seems to be a little over the top as it is just not that bright. On high, it is noticibly brighter than on medium and low, but I feel like the battery life sacrifice may not be worth it (i still use on high and charge every use, safety first). all that said, if you can get a deal on it (I did not), go for it, it is a decent light. I will try to get one that is brighter, heavier built, with a larger battery next time around.\n\nUpdate: lowered to 1 star. Used the light daily for 2 weeks for about an hour, and 2 days after riding on wet roads, the light began to act up. The charger port has white corrosion, and there is water droplets behind the lens. My experience may be different than others, but the light needs to be water resistant from waters spray from the back tire. My particular light may have had sealing issues, and most may be fine, but this warrants 1 star for the light. The company gave me a full refund and were very apologetic, so I am trying a different model.", "summary": "just ok... (Update: not very water resistant)", "unixReviewTime": 1466121600}

Always have been. As a small business owner and firearms instructor, I need a backpack that will house my laptop, client files, concealed carry gun (or guns....depending on what I'm carrying), and various other small things (pens, flashlights, spare mags, charger cables, etc).  This backpack is perfect for urban (or suburban) uses because it is not a big box on your back like standard issue military gear that looks and feels weird to be carrying around work, town, etc. It's shaped such that all the flat things (laptop, files, etc) sit against your back and the peripheral junk is towards the bottom. This puts the weight closer to your hips and allows it to stand up more when I set it down.\n  In the main compartment there is a kind of hidden area for concealed carry or maybe files that you want separated. The other compartments are pretty self explanatory. There is however a pretty cool little compartment at the very top near the handle (one of my favorite features) that has a soft lined compartment that is advertised as the place to put your iPod or iPhone with the ear buds coming out and into your ear. I liten to music via my iPhone, so I can't have it back there in case someone calls as it would be inconvenient to have to take off your backpack everytime you got a call. Actually I guess you could just answer the phone without looking at the screen to see who's calling, but for some reason I don't ever do that.... anyway, I use it for my wallet, keys glasses/sunglasses, etc. Pretty cool little pouch.\n  My only complaint is that the little plastic knobs at the end of the paracord attached to the zippers are not very high quality. This is a very small deal and pretty nit-picky but it's a tad annoying so I thought I'd mention it. There are twelve of them on the back pack and 5 of them are either gone (leaving the paracord pull string unconnected) or in various states of falling apart. This is certainly not a deal break as they zippers with the paracord string work fine. Just thought I'd mention it.\n  Anyway, I have the black one and absolutely love it.

The Spark from the Steel lites this so fast you won't know what hit you. But the fire dosent last as long as with vasoline imprenated cotton ball so you have to HURRY and get your fine kindling on your \"PREFIRE\"One has to practice with this steeland different tenders.

Yeah, you'll have some extra pieces but they can always be cut down and used to replace the worn parts on the slide.\n\nI have not put these to the test yet, so after I see how they hold up to sweat, water, dirt, etc. I'll update the review.\n\nNOTE: These do not fit 100% perfect on the 45ACP, as 45GAP is just a little bit smaller..but that does not bother me. There is another version of this grip specifically for 45ACP (just look around for it on Amazon) but I actually like that they are a little smaller than the raised portion of the grip on my 45ACP because there's less of a \"lip\" on the edges of the sandpaper to get caught/peeled back.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAfter putting these grips through an all day torture test, I still don't think they are as good as Talon grips, but they do work.

These are not like that. I was examining the foot bed today, and each of the honeycomb shapes is woven thicker than the lighter material around them. This allows them to be very thin, yet still provide a surprising amount of cushioning. The thicker honeycombs spread out a bit to the thinner parts when compressed. I'm not sure how they are doing this, but it is really impressive.\n\nI followed the sizing chart and ordered the large for a 10.5 US Male shoe size, and they fit my feet perfectly, with no extra material in the toe bed. This is common for me with socks, and I hate it. I was glad these didn't have that problem.\n\nThey have silver embedded in them, which helps retard bacterial growth. A good thing for socks. If it weren't for the expense involved, all socks would have this - at least they should.\n\nThe little fluffy heel helps it stay in place. I hate it when my socks slip down under my foot, and these were good about not doing that.\n\nI will say that even though they are labeled as compression socks, they don't really compress very much.

It's cool because it fits in a closet in my apartment and easily in my truck bed but most people would struggle carrying the large heavy bag long distances. I suggest making very sure you have it fully inflated as all rigidity is lost otherwise. With this fully inflated I do still experience a bending where I am sitting but it comes with an inflatable pillow thing to jam in the corner...put it in the back corner and you'll be fine. It also seems quite durable. Similar material to whitewater rafts. I got caught in a rapidly leaving tide out in the mangroves and hit quite a few sharp sticks and things and didn't sink.\n\nIt actually tracks surprisingly well because of the added length and rudder thing you can put on the bottom. Tracks better than most cheaper end molded kayaks for sure.\n\nThe perks of having it oversized are immense. Plenty of leg room (for once) room for a cooler and all my fishing gear without being cramped. I always throw the air pump in the netting compartment also just to be safe.\n\nOnly complaint is I wish it had a collapsible fiberglass rod or 2 like a tent to give some stability to the hull.", "summary": "Cant beat the price...i got mine \"used\" aka open box from amazon warehouse", "unixReviewTime": 1441411200}

Finally after years of abuse, the lid cracked after dropping it, while full, on the corner of the lid. I feel like this is expected, it's plastic. But absolutely totally worth replacing. I was devastated to think that I couldn't buy a replacement, so when I found this I was SOOO EXCITED.\n\nI've purchased an additional 4 bottles, from Amazon (because the top is $7.99 and with the bottle it's $10.20) and I use the top on my 32 oz Nalgene. I got a replacement one for the one that cracked, one for my boyfriend after he kept drinking out of my bottle, and two for my Dad to put on his Nalgenes after he saw me using mine and was jealous.\n\nI can't figure out why people don't like it, and why it would get a bad review. I've had it leak when I don't screw the top on all the way (duh). Sometimes if there is a dramatic shift in temperature and the bottle is upside down there MAY be some that comes out of the air flow valve, but other than that I've NEVER had a leak problem that wasn't user error. I take it everywhere and often sleep with it next to me in bed. I don't often use the straw (sometimes when driving) just because I LOVE the \"chugger\" so much. The key is the perfect size opening and the AIR INTAKE VALVE!!  I can drink practically the whole thing in one go because I don't have to stop to let it breathe, and I can just seal around the chugger and drink.\n\nThis is THE BEST lid/top for a Nalgene ever made.

We recently received several guy-style watches from HiWatch and he really likes their look and feel. He is a teenage car guy type of kid, and these watches are right up his alley.\n\nThis is described as a military-style watch with blue coloration and several functions. It is a nice looking watch, and not terrible heavy, though the face of the watch is fairly large at about 1.75 inches in diameter. It keeps decent time, needed to be adjusted by a minute or so every week, but it is quite affordable.\n\nThis watch is water resistant but it is not waterproof, even though that word is used in the listing title. The watch specs are \"30m, 3ATM\" which does not mean you can safely wear it in 30 meters of water... per written standards, this rating does  mean \"will easily withstand splashes or brief immersion in water, or getting caught in the rain. However, it is not sufficiently resistant for swimming or bathing\". That is OK with us, though the seller should correct the tile to read water resistant not waterproof.\n\nThis battery-powered watch keeps good time, is relatively lightweight and is comfortable to wear. The strap adjusts easily to wrist size, and the underside of the watch fits well against the shape of the wrist. Our son finds it to be quite comfortable.\n\nThe Amazon listing notes that this watch is covered by a \"2 years warranty\" with a \"2 months hassle-free return policy\" and that the \"Seller pays for return if item is DOA or not as described\"... a great commitment to customer satisfaction. We received this nice watch gratis from the seller and our son put it to use to objectively see how well the watch fit and functioned. My statement here reflects that testing.\n\nIf you are looking for a great watch for your teen car-guy, a battery operated watch of this price, size and style, for use as I have described above, then our son would highly recommend giving this watch from Hiwatch a try based on his experience with it.\n\nVery recommended.\n\nGo for it.", "summary": "Hiwatch Kingsky Water Resistant Watch - Blue & Black Military Sports design - Great for our son - LED - Works well - Recommended", "unixReviewTime": 1429833600}

Now the details. The bicycle looks indeed great and I would like to give it 5000 stars! But boy they trashed the quality! One would expect some great Italian quality since the mambo-jumbo \"accacio\" is translated in the advertising like the Italian for steel. They should put in the description the chinese for crap instead. Immediately after assembly I could see 3 major problems:\n1) The vertical middle screw intended to tighten the handlebar has a very shallow hex key imprint in the middle, and that will guarantee stripping the screw when tightening the handlebar.\n2) The cable from the front wheel break to the brake handle is way too short, some 4 inches too short I would say. That is keeping the cable in a very weird, straight and post-tensioned position, with one leg of the brake pulled close to the wheel on one side. The cable can not be adjusted, the half inch or so screw adjustment is way less than required. And the brake cable is wrapped tight to the handlebar ...\n3) The wheel spokes seem to be adjusted when eyeballing the shape of the wheel but it is impossible to really test it. The problem is with the rubber placed on these wheels. The shape of the rubber after inflating the wheels is bulging in a few places more than half of inch! On at least one place I've seen the rubber with a significant diameter less than normal! That will make you feel like riding over big stones while riding on flat pavement, jumping up and down. I will have to remove the crap put there by these chinese manufacturer and buy real tires.", "summary": "Superb look, garbage quality", "unixReviewTime": 1451865600}

It is comfortable though.\n\nI have subtracted a star for the following reasons:\n\nColor - I was expecting a darker forest camo.  From every image, the majority of the belt appears to be forest green.  Instead, it is a desert camo, which is more khaki instead of green.  Not a huge fan of the color.  Did this change at some point?\n\nCarabiners - I like the concept of using carabiners and straps.  However, the carabiner receiving latch is jagged when open.  This causes it to get caught on the belt loop when removing the added weight.  This is aggravating and adds to the time it takes to dismount the weight, and feels cumbersome when you are leaning/squatting to remove the weight.\n\nPrice - its about twice as much as other dip belts.  It uses straps and carabiners vs. a chain.  The quality of materials seems high, and  I do like this design because it doesn't scrape paint or chip the kettlebells I'm using.  However, the price is still a bit high.  However, this is somewhat justified by the  different options the design allows.\n\nAll in all, I am happy with the belt so far.  I do think that Brute Belt should post pictures that more accurately reflect the actual color of the belt.  I also think the belt loop could be layered with a stiffer material or that a different carabiner could be used to avoid the snagging I mentioned.", "summary": "Pretty Good", "unixReviewTime": 1439769600}

In each workout, after a short warmup, she goes through a round (or circuit) of exercises.  There is a modifier in each workout.  In the upper body workout, she uses a band (which I loved since I really enjoy band workouts).  She's worth following even if you stick with dumbbells.  In the lower-body workout, the modifier uses either lower weights or no weights.  In each workout, the first set is 16 reps, the second is 8 reps with 2 counts, the last is 4 reps with 4 counts. There's an on-screen timer and caption for each exercise. The core workout includes Pilates type floor workout without traditional crunches.\n\nUnfortunately, the DVD isn't chaptered, so you can't skip ahead in a workout.  You have to fast forward, if you want to skip ahead.  From the menu, there are options to do voice only, music + cues, or cues only, where Karen only cues the moves. I don't think I even heard the music, so I can't tell you what it's like.  She gives quite a few form pointers throughout the workout, which I like.  She leads the workout with two background exercisers, one who modifies and one who does what Karen does.  When there is a third more advanced option, Karen does it.\n\nFor an intermediate exerciser, these are very doable workouts and the modifier really makes them accessible.  I like the no-nonsense, straight forward instruction. The pace is slow enough that you can go heavy with the weights, whatever that means to you.

The blade is sharp, I tried cutting nylon straps versus my kanetsune 11 layer damascus steel blade and both cut the straps like butter, no complaints there.\n\nFourth, the clip is nice, very tight fit so no fear of losing, and hides the knife low in pocket, out of sight.\n\nSo far I must say I love this knife and would recommend it.

I'll update this when I have that experiential feedback. I've built bikes since High School as part-time work as a kid, --some time ago now, to present.\n\nI can't imagine, with this design, it being funcational if not as well made, --it appears as well and appropirately made.\n\nI won't be able to compare to other offerings, yet comment this comparison thought, --just knowking how other manufactures make something look like something else, but not made as well. If someone offers \"this\" for less, great, let folks know (!) with the A - B, direct comparison determinations.\n\nA couple of immediate observations that may or may not be of issue to someone else is:\n  a) the unit cannot be folded or unfolded, (by me), as one might expect (all the way) with the *Tool-Tray attached. The *Tray has to be removed to do so. For me, I'm not sure it's \"necessary\" for what it is (the Tray).\n\nMoreover, with all the electronic data products around, I'd hate to have someone put their Phone, etc. on it and have all the data *erased on it's SD card, or otherwise the units memory. Remember, the tray is *Magnetized, with a large magnet attached to the back, that will hold a small wrench in place. Don't put any electronic device on it.\n\n  b) *unfolding it, pushing the collar down by hand to extend the two \"V\" supporting legs was impossible (for me). For what ever reason this might be the case, --tight fit, thick lubricant, no lubricant, I had to push one leg a little bit at a time, or hold the \"V\" legs with my feet and pull up on the center post. The one leg, little bit at a time worked best, for me. In time this may become less of an issue. However, if you push in one leg alone, you will damage it.\n\n  c) At this point, not having used it, used it for a while, I am concerned with one thing, --one person clamping it in. (Having used air, compressor powerd shop, foot activated clamps while with two hands lift hold/hang and clamp in, I don't see how one person would mount the bike as per the advertised picture.)\n\nI am anticipating, to have to hang it with a cross bar, other bike-part, then clamp it. To then adjust the work height, would, at this time, seem to be ill advised, --work height would be set first. Therefore, this being an assumed one-person process (one can always get help?) or if doing in-field work at a \"rally\" ... nonetheless, think that part through for yourself. It didn't occur to me until I unpacked it and see how tight it all is (a good thing to be \"tightly\" made, yet, part of my present concern).\n\nIf I can upload some pictures at/upon unpacking it, I will do so here; and, again update my use experience with it which is the most important element.\n\nI make such an issue of this one person thing because, me being a fairly \"big-guy\", so to speak, don't see a slighter buld person one handly lifting an \"average-typical\" (?) bike, balancing the free standing -stand, and clamping without a \"trip\" spring to initally grab the bike on the stand.\n\nI don't see myself, yet, as returning it, but upon first use in the next day or so, that may change.", "summary": "Aluminum Cycle Pro Mechanic Bicycle Repair Stand Rack Bike by CyclingDeal", "unixReviewTime": 1411862400}

Before buying this one I've previously had two hammocks and i've given one to my girlfriend and both my siblings. This is the nicest one that I've used so far for a couple reasons. First is that it's a double allowing two people to share it, it's got plenty of room even for two. For one person the sides just come up higher; and you can just lay at an angle or pull the sides down (as they aren't under tension) to easily see out. Second is the quality, it's got a thick and sturdy cloth without being too heavy; along with god stitching and solid attachment points. Third is that it is quite comfortable; hammocks are usually very good but this has even less shoulder and feet compression than my others. Part of that has to be because this is a double with more fabric allowing more sleeping positions and a greater angle to sleep at.\n\nA couple tips for using the hammock\n-Lay at an angle to reduce compression, most important at shoulders and feet\n-Look into proper setup or at least do some trial and error to find what is most comfortable\n  You'll want a decent amount of sag, too little and you'll feel pressured, too much and you'll be folded at the waist\n-If you're sleeping in it definitely get a sleeping pad as you can lose a lot of heat through the bottom of a hammock to the air/wind\n-If you are camping in one you should get a hammock fly to protect from the rain; there are ones made especially for hammocks but can be pricy (even more than a hammock) but i've been using a UST Tube Tarp, which costs much less and still works perfectly fine.\n\nOverall I am quite happy with this hammock and will certainly be using it for camping and relaxing. The only negative I would note is the price of the rope kit. It's nice to get everything you need in one package but for the price of the rope you could get a hammock strap set which I greatly prefer for ease of setup. I'm not taking a star off for the rope price as it's not required that you buy it and the hammock is seriously my favorite.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure; I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review.

So, after a few weeks, either leave the Mojos at home, or just use one--with a remote--so you can turn it on and off.

I have had the problem of losing the red tube just like everyone else. I finally decided to tkae a matching spray nozzle from an empty can - similar, but different in that the uptake tube that siphons the liquid from the can had a wider opening due to being made from thinner plastic.\n\nThink about a cocktail straw versus a regular soda straw that has the same outer diameter. The cocktail straw is designed to slow down the flow of the drink to the mouth since some people seem to be unable to sip a cocktail from the rim of the glass. The soda straw is just the opposite - to get as much fluid out of a can or glass into your mouth.\n\nNozzles come in two varieties: either the uptake tube is a part of the can and the nozzle spout fits over it - OR - the nozzle is permanently attached to the spout and the end of it fits into the can's partially sealed opening. This second method is typically used on spray paint cans.\n\nOK, now FORTUNATELY the little red nozzle on the CLP is totally separate from the uptake tube wqhich is oermanently attached to the can.\n\nSO-O-O, you need to find another nozzle like it (since many have used the CLP spray can and probably cursed the first time that tiny red tube was launched into space), so getting one from a used or empty can (or even a full can from an annoyed user) should not be a problem. Ask around at the range.\n\nIf you can get the skinny red spray tube also, that would be GREAT because I'm going to have you make that little red tube a permanent part of the nozzle, and to use a thick rubber band to keep the tube with the can.\n\nGet a headless nail, a sewing pin, a piece of wire, or anything else made of metal that will slide in and out of the tube and is almost as wide as the inside of the tube. In other words, thick enough to slide in and out without getting stuck in it.\n\nSlide the metal inside the red tube. It should already have CLP on the inside so it should slide in easy.. Wipe off about 2\" of one end of the red tube with rubbing alcohol to remove every bit of solvent on the outside.\n\nThe purpose of the metal insert is to keep the inside of the tube free of the Super-Glue (plastic cement, Gorilla glue, etc) that you are going to put on the very end of the red tube. The metal insert should be flush with the end of the tube.  Be careful not to get any glue on the metal insert.\n\nHold the can horizontally and point the tube straight down at a rag or a few sheets of paper towel you placed beneath it. Take the glue end of the red tube and insert it all the way into the nozzle. While holding the spray tube with your free hand, press down on the nozzle to spray the insert out of the tube.\n\nWhen it's out of the tube, let go of the red tube and tilt the can to its normal vertical position. Set it off to the side to let the glue dry completely.\n\nNow that the red tube is permanently glued to the nozzle, you can put the nozzle back on the siphon tube and never worry about losing that tube again.\n\nLASTLY, there is a trick to spraying the CLP so that it does not foam up into a ball or oversaturate what yhou are spraying.\n\nInstead of pressing straight down on the nozzle with the tip of your finger, you're going to take the tip of your finger, rest it on top of the nozzle, and gently press down and back on the rear of the nozzle with your finger direcly in line with the red tube.\n\nIn other words, you will be gently TIPPING the nozzle down and backwards, as slowly as possible, until the spray starts to come out of the red tube.\n\nALSO, instead of holding the spray can in a horizontal position, you will hold it vertically and tilt it about 20 degrees forward (as if the can was pointing to the 1 o'clock position on a watch face).\n\nThe idea is to tilt the can to let the liquid come out without a lot of pressurized gas behind it. The part of your gun that is to receive the spray should be horizontal so that the liquid stays in place. You want to distribute the liquid by moving the red tube from front to back over the area that needs the treatment.\n\nGoing from front to back keeps the spray from traveling beyond the point you want treated.\n\nWhen done, hold the can vertically on a table top while you gently lift up on the nozzle to remove it from the siphon tube - taking care not to touch or snag the red tube.\n\nPrior to doing all of the above (although you can do it now), you will have stretched a thick rubber band around the lower third of the can. Move the hand holding the can downwards and pull back on the rubber band about an inch or so. With your other hand, hold the nozzle/tube combo by the nozzle and rotate it so that the tube points straight down and then slide it under the rubber band until the end of the red tube rests on top of the lip that is part of the bottom of the can.\n\nThis will keep the red tube empty as well as giving it some support to hold it in its vertical position. The reason why you put the rubber band along the bottom third and not around the middle is to keep from bending the tube and also applying pressure against the joint where the tube was glued to the nozzle.\n\nTo remove and replace the nozzle, simply reverse the process listed above.\n\nWhen storing the can, always make sure to have the tube facing upwards or to the front to prevent it from being accidentally removed from under the rubber band.", "summary": "How to deal with that pesky spray can and spray tube", "unixReviewTime": 1411430400}

The rack comes with one shelf that will hold several accessories including helmets in the special slots made for the clasp to slide into.

I bought it \"used\" but it was basically brand new. It looked like it may have been used as a demo model that nobody picked up or handled. The only thing that clued you was the cut and resealed plastic. Otherwise, not a mark or blemish on it.\n\nIt is the perfect size for an EDC knife with a far better edge profile for utility than a traditional hook design while still being adequate for the intended purpose. Even though it isn't a hook, the belly is good enough at the angle to really bite in. The blade edge comes sharp enough and only takes a bit of touch up. But, the edge is very thin. While the blade has a nice utility shape I wouldn't expect it to hold it's edge if you go hacking away on cardboard. Buy a box cutter for that. But, for cutting cordage or through cloth, it would do admirable work.\n\nIt has a different way of opening than the \"wave\" type copies. You can't see it in the picture but there is an extension coming off of the blade on the knife's spine. You sweep the knife forward on the draw stroke to catch the extension on the leading edge of the pocket. It seems counter-intuitive at first but once you get used to it, it's just as fast as the wave style design. What is really nice is the opening \"support\" at the back edge of the handle by the finger hoop. It locks in place both opened and closed. When opened it does provide a lot of extra control and leverage. But, it's actual purpose for a kerambit is as a pressure point probe.

After getting the hang of using them, however, my thoughts changed. With the connectors, you can arrange the umbrella pretty much however you want it. The clamp is good and stable. We were in brutally hot conditions without shade on a really windy day, but we were able to set these umbrellas up on our chairs and beat the heat. They held up well in the wind (I was originally nervous that they weren't going to hold up under sustained 20 mph winds with 30 mph gusts, but they did). I am very pleased with this product. They come with a nice carrying case and folding them up is pretty easy.\n\nPlease note that we got the XL version. I feel that if I had not gotten the XL version, they would have been too short and I couldn't have gotten underneath it in my chair. Even the XL version required me to sneak up into my chair from below given the sun conditions we were experiencing. But they provide a nice patch of shade and they don't heat through underneath.\n\nOne more thing: These are sun shades, not umbrellas for rain. They would not work well in the rain, so don't buy them as rain umbrellas.\n\nOverall, this is a really well-thought-out product and I am happy with my purchase! We will will be using them again and again.", "summary": "If you are big or tall, get the XL version", "unixReviewTime": 1529539200}

Battery life could perhaps be better for a strobe however.  I have no connection to this company, nor did I receive this light at any discount as some other reviewers have.  Why 4 and not 5 stars?  I received what seems to be a de rigueur email from companies now that sell here and elsewhere asking about the product and imploring a 5 star review.  If the product deserves 5 stars, I will give it regardless of that prevalent practice.  However, if they ask, and if I have a problem, however minor, I will inform them.  Obviously they want to know.  What else would they be asking for.  I immediately replied to their email by stating it was a great light but I had two minor issues, one perhaps \"normal\" operation that could be improved, and another problem.\n1.  The charging light does not change color when fully charged.  Perhaps that's just my unit, but I doubt it.  Don't most charging lights either flash while charging and then become steady?  Or are orange, as is this one, and then become green when charged?  Minor quibble, not a big deal at all, but I passed it on.\n2.  The mount, which is basically a flexible piece of rubber and thus mounts quickly and is very easy to place, then has a channel in which the light slides.  It seems as if it should then snap in place so it won't come out unless the thumb tab is pressed.  Mine perhaps is not machined properly as it does not push all the way down and thus will not lock in place.\n\nWhen I emailed the above back to the company, they replied: \"Thank you for the valuable feedback.\"  I'd have to give that reply 1 star.  1 star for replying.  Zero stars for addressing an issue I brought up that could potentially result in losing the light when going over bumps.", "summary": "A bright light with minor flaws.", "unixReviewTime": 1452297600}

The pads, being only 12 inches apart, did not grip the sides of the kayak, hence the sideways slippage.  However, when sliding the kayak back off the rack, it slipped to the side of the car and fell to the ground.  This always happened unless the car was on perfectly level ground.  The back pads are very slippery whereas the front pads have a more gripping surface.  Once the kayak is moved off of the front pads, it becomes unstable toward sliding to the side.  If the carrier was wider so that the pads could be moved farther apart to the sides of the kayak, it might work with a SOT.

On both my road bikes I've used SPD pedals and recently bought some new shoes (Vittoria Hora Evo). Shopped around and ended up with the Look Keo 2 Max pedals in black, since everything else on the bike is already black. I did consider speedplay as it was recommended by a few of my friends who had them, but I just did not like the large plate surface that you have to install to the bottom of these road shoes. Walking around is already difficult in the road shoes, why make it any more difficult? I also did not like the fact that you have to keep them lubed. I wanted something simple, so the only choices that came down to were the LOOK, TIME and Shimano. The bike that I was putting these pedals on was full campy, so I didn't want to mix in Shimano, since it'll look out of place. The Campy pedals double the price of these and also heavier too. It came down to TIME and LOOK. I searched through many forums and read through many articles and in the end chose the LOOK. I like how there is more float option with these pedals compared to the TIME.\n\nI love how large the platform is on these road pedals compared to the SPD pedals. I also love how secure it feels when I am \"clipped in\". I find these much easier to get in than the SPD pedals that I have. It also weighs a WHOLE LOT less! They are also very easy to clip out! It's pretty much the same method to clip in and out as you would if you had the SPD pedals. The only difference is the clip in part where you have to make sure the nose part of the cleats is aligned with the contact point of the pedal.\n\nInstallation on these pedals were a bit easier and quicker than the SPD pedals, but once you've done a few pedal installations they are all the same. I wouldn't bother taking it to a LBS to install for 5 or 10 bucks when you can do it yourself! These call out for a 40NM torque, so if you don't already have a torque wrench, I suggest purchasing one on here.\n\nOverall, I am very satisfied with the purchase and I will recommend these to friends who are looking for new road pedals.", "summary": "From MTB to Road", "unixReviewTime": 1372291200}

If that doesn't do it, two crimped stainless steel rings will, one by the thimble and one at the end of splice.\n\nThe rope itself is no better and no worse then one I can find in local hardware store, mediocre splicing job has to be fixed.\n\nUpdate:\nHeat shrink did the trick, if you follow this trick be sure to get correct size shrink wrap, it shrinks to half of its original size, therefore you need\n3/4 inch shrink wrap to seal 3//8 inch rope splicing.\nBecause splicing is larger in diameter then original rope, stop applying heat when there is evidence of snug confirmation to splicing contour.\nLet this cool for few minutes then apply second piece over it, this creates fairly thick, rubber like skin over splicing that remains flexible and holds splicing against falling apart when stored loose.\nHeat gun is essential for uniform and controlled heat application, if done right, heat shrink will hug rope's contour and prevent it from coming loose, yet remain in flexible, rubber like state, if it gets dry and hard, you got too much heat  on it and need to redo the whole thing with new piece.\nMy anchor line is now 4 star product that should have been done to higher quality standard at the factory.

Since the rain fly is velcroed to tents poles, guywired to ground stakes and attached to tent pole rings with bungee cord, removing the rain fly was not practical.

Any experienced airgunner will tell you that the pellets your buddy shoots through his rifle with great results may shoot like absolute garbage in yours. You just have to buy a few tins and find the one that works best for your air rifle and setup. For me, these turned out to be the best I've used so far.\n\nI'm running these through a Crosman 2400KT Carbine from the Crosman Custom Shop. Mine has the 18\" crosman barrel using a TKO muzzle brake, which I highly recommend as it quietens down the muzzle report to almost nothing. For optics I am using an AIM Sports dual illuminated reflex sight, which can be found here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CDPE6B4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Without accessories, this air rifle totaled just over 100 bucks plus shipping, so this is by no means a high end air rifle. It's a simple low fps, low maintenance backyard plinker and very small pest popper. Before using these, I ran some oil and cleaning patches through the barrel to get any debris knocked loose so that I could get an honest feel for the pellets. I wanted to set the scale as close to zero as I could so that I can get real data for my review.\n\nThe short answer is, for me, these little boogers are fantastic. I fired about 30 shots through my carbine just getting the dot close to home and to get some lead in the barrel, then popped in a new CO2 cartridge and used the next four shots to dial it in at ten yards. After that, I moved the target back to 20 yards and fired four more shots. I could cover the group with a quarter, and remember, I was shooting with a 1x red dot, not a scope. With a scope, these would have probably been easily covered by a nickel. Before using these I shot Crosman premier .22 Hollowpoints and Domed, Crosman standard pointed, as well as all of the Benjamin .22 Pellet Sampler types. I couldn't get the shots to stay anywhere close to consistent with a single one of those pellets. I know some people complain about accuracy problems with pointed style pellets, but that's simply not the case with these little guys. Out of my first 30 shots, I did have 2, maybe 3 flyers who didn't group with the rest of the herd.\n\nNow that we've talked about accuracy, let's talk about the quality of the pellet itself, as well as penetration. These arrived undamaged and the tin was in great condition, for which I was much relieved. I did have to throw two pellets out of the test group because of slightly dented skirts, but it seems to me about 95% of the pellets are in great condition, which is a high number considering I've opened undamaged Crosman tins to find 15-20% of the pellets malformed or damaged. As far as penetration goes, these pellets really drill home. They seem to penetrate extremely well, and it's pretty obvious to me why that is. The points are well formed, have a good bit of material to them, and seem to be perfectly centered along the body of the pellet. I was really impressed by this. High penetration was exactly what I needed for my low fps carbine, because I don't trust the gun to push a flat or domed pellet hard enough to whack the various pests I have to dispose of. These almost guarantee a clean kill on very small critters due to great accuracy and penetration. Due to the lower fps of my air rifle, I can't offer an opinion as to penetration on game as big as a squirrel or rabbit. I just don't feel comfortable shooting something that size with my air rifle, so I apologize that I can't say how well they would do in that regard. Pest birds of medium to small size drop like a rock, though.\n\nOverall, I'm really happy with these, and went ahead and ordered 3 more tins to stock up a bit. As I said before, every air rifle will have pellets it likes and pellets it won't shoot straight no matter what you do. If you're still searching for a quality pellet for yours, I'd say that this is a great pellet to pick up and see, especially at this price point. You may just be blown away like I was. Best of luck, happy airgunning, and always remember to stay safe and be responsible while enjoying the sport. Cheers!", "summary": "Any experienced airgunner will tell you that the pellets your buddy shoots through his rifle with great results may shoot like a", "unixReviewTime": 1422489600}

First up, after pitching the tent I admire it for a while - it looks really good, compact and the orange / grey combo is beautiful. It has performed wonderfully so far. It is very easy to set up: First time, I set it up in the almost total darkness with light from a small lantern in about 5 minutes. Similarly, dismantling the tent is also a quick process. It is very spacious for two average sized people. Of course one can only sit or lie down inside it. There is ample space to keep things such as flashlights, water bottles etc around the bed. The rain fly works great as well. I have used it in 2 nights of constant rain at RMNP, with the inside staying completely dry. I have never had issues with moisture buildup (and puddles of water) inside the tent - the two vents for air circulation are great in this regard. This is a major positive for me as my first experience camping was in a Eureka tent in AK which flooded in the rain, and had constant moisture buildup issues forming puddles. In moderately windy conditions, the tent has been stable.  I purchased two tarps at Rec Equip., cut them to match the base of the tent, taped up and use it as a footprint. The material is of good quality, and looks like it will last. It is quite lightweight after packing up - maybe not for backpacking, but easily fits in a large trunk/suitcase without adding much weight for checking-in on flights. Some issues, which others have pointed out: the stakes are useless, and bend easily. Get good steel stakes. When pulling the poles out of the grommets, the ends come off and it is a pain to insert them back again. There is a mesh \"loft\" provided, but I have no idea how to fix it on the ceiling. The hooks on the loft do not match up with the loops. I don't camp in extreme heat or in winter, so I cannot speak for its performance in those conditions. Overall, it is a great tent for camping trips for two people (car camping; at campgrounds; nice fall weather...). Highly recommended.", "summary": "ALPS chaos 2", "unixReviewTime": 1417910400}

Was debating between the latest FoxPro calls but couldn't believe how much they were asking for them. The Alpha Dogg is hundreds $$ less than the FoxPro and performs as good if not better! Small enough to fit in a small backpack or hand carry but loud enough to be used in the widest open of ranges.\n\nThe volume of the Alpha Dogg is great! And from of the review I have read on other sites better than some of the FoxPro calls.  I had this call on it's middle setting and it was still loud enough to call across an open field into the wind. At the loudest settings it could be used in the open prairies with ease. And the volume is adjustable on the remote at any time. The Alpha Dogg is very portable and has directional speakers to cover every avenue of approach. The Alpha Dogg also has built in legs to get it off the ground which fold up and help to protect the side speakers when not in use or while transporting.\n\nThe remote for the Alpha Dogg is much better than any I've seen from Fox Pro and very user friendly. It's back lit with adjustable lighting. Large display and large buttons and shows the length of time calling and remaining in the call sequence as well as list the different calls in order on the a preset expert mode and shows which one is currently playing. The range on the Alpha Dogg remote is listed as 200 yds and I can verify that this is indeed true if not a little understated. There are numerous calls on the Alpha Dogg and even a few routines that are setup under the expert hunt modes that have varying calls as well as moments of silence and varying volumes built into the routine.\n\nOverall impression: Outstanding Call! Biggest and best bang for the buck. Great Features, Great Volume, Excellent Range on the remote and numerous calls available on the Alpha Dogg as shipped and many more that you can download and install yourself.\n\nHighly recommend!", "summary": "Best bang for the buck!!", "unixReviewTime": 1328745600}

The 2 pieces are of different thicknesses. On my rifle, the front base is thinner than the rear base which causes my scope to angle slightly downwards. This isn't obvious until you try to zero in your rifle and I'm sure this is by design as these mounts afterall are designed for this specific type of rifle.\n\nI've taken this rifle to the range numerous times attempting to zero in the elevation and im at the limit of adjusting the scope, which is not a top end model, but also far from the bottom. The result of this problem is that at 50 yards, my shots are about 5 inches high. This means that the front of the scope is not high enough in relation to the rear. Raising the reticle in the scope so that it matches the point of impact would correct this problem, but I cannot adjust it any higher. My options are either to 1) shim the front mount to make it thicker, or 2) replace this product with bases that are more uniform in height, or purchase a seperate ring for the front that is higher than the rear. My rings are identical in height currently. I'm taking this rifle Elk hunting next month and am extremely dissapointed that I cannot get my scope to zero with this base. Also, due to the design of the rifle, I am unable to swap out the front and rear bases. The screw holes on the remington are seperated by different distances, as you can see from the picture of this product, the holes in the bases are also set (as expected) differently. It's impossible to swap them. They may work fine on your rifle / scope combination but on mine they are unusable and I've been fiddling with it for well over a year. I'm probably going to give these a try - http://www.amazon.com/Remington-Integral-Scope-Mounts-Medium/dp/B002IWYAX6/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1350328997&sr=1-1&keywords=remington+700+scope+mounts\n\nOr might go with some adjustable mounts so I know I'll be able to get them to work. I'm subtracting major stars for this because for my application, which is the intended one for this product, they are useless.

Unlike some sports watches, this one tries to look fashionable, with a rather large square body and a really beautiful crystal front.  It is fairly large, about an inch-and-a-quarter by and inch-and-a-half on the face, and a good quarter inch thick.  It comes with a brown leather band that is about 1/2 inch wide.  I can wear this pretty comfortably (am a 6 ft tall man of moderate frame), but my guess is that others would find it to be too big and heavy.\n\nIn  terms of being a sports watch tracking activity, it is pretty good, though I can't really judge how accurate the heart rate monitor is.\n\nIn general, I found more to dislike about this watch than to like.  It is difficult to set the watch in that there are endless menus you need to go through and it is just time consuming to make a small change.  The watch has a nice display (numbers or a watch dial image) but I found it pretty hard to read in sunlight and impossible at night - the display is not illuminated.\n\nOne problem I had is that although instructions claimed it would keep a charge for a week, I found it drained in 4-5 days, even without a lot of active use (e.g. heart rate monitor on).\n\nIt connected OK with my phone, but it recorded only basic data.\n\nOverall, I found this pretty disappointing, especially for very high price.  Although you could wear it as a regular watch (it is attractive in my opinion), it really is not a very good fitness watch - basically counts steps and computes distance, measures heart rate, and otherwise works as a basic watch and stop watch.  For half the money , you could have a fitbit and a good fitness watch like a Polar brand watch, used with a heart rate monitor when you need.  The combination would give you a lot more capabilities than this watch  does, which tries I think to be too many things (including a fashionable street watch) but really doesn't succeed well in any one things - it is too much of a compromise.\n\nI would say this watch  is not great but really isn't bad.  I think giving it three stars is a bit generous - It is to me a C- product.

The material of this mat does not have a very durable surface and it tears with normal usage.\n\nIn my opinion, this mat is a 're-use' of a foam material designed for some other use.

Even with three Puck Pros it was grossly overpriced. Effectively, it's just a standard USB cable and a separate plastic clip with two metal contact points. The plastic clip is the part you need and what you're paying for. But as others have said, there's really no choice.\n\nAfter installing a driver from a third party web page onto our Mac, I was able to upload dives from the Puck Pros just fine. I also successfully updated all three Puck Pros to the latest firmware rev (as of the date of this review, 3.33). You need to position the clip properly, but I did not have any issues keeping it on any of the three computers. A green light means the clip is just powered by the Mac, red means it's actually electrically connected to the Puck Pro (if you see red and DiversDiary still can't see the Puck Pro, you may not have fully installed the third party driver. Note that installation of this driver on a Mac required a restart as well). At that point, if the Mac has all the drivers you need, the DiversDiary app can do its magic.\n\nI would recommend not touching it or bumping the clip while updating the firmware, and make sure you have plenty of battery before updating. The firmware updates did not erase any of the data on the Puck Pros, and didn't take very long.\n\nThe software is fun to look at and play with, although it's none too stable (it crashes occasionally). That, the ability to update the firmware, and sharing the cable between the three computers made it somewhat worthwhile to purchase one cable in our case. I don't think I'd be very happy buying this if I only had one Puck Pro.", "summary": "All Functionality Appears to Work Fine on a Mac", "unixReviewTime": 1417737600}

It would not point north, nor does it spin freely so i constantly get W at the north position or sometimes E lol.  Don't rely on the compass,  but a general compass can be used in emegencies if you have a standard watch with hour/minute hands.  For northern hemisphere lay the watch flat in your palm facing up.  If you have trees or a pole,  look a the shadow,  point the hours hand at the shadow line it up, this is pointing at the sun.  Now find the  point between the hours hand and 12 oclock position,  this should be pointing to your south,  and opposite that should be the north.

I noted this discrepancy directly with the company, and received a prompt reply explaining that the bags actually are filled with the synthetic filament, but that the tags erroneously say cotton due to a translation error with the manufacturer overseas. In addition, the company responded to my concern that the price on Amazon is higher than on the company's website by explaining that they have to do that in the event of low stock on the Amazon site because they are penalized if they run out of product. They generously refunded me the difference between the Amazon price and the seller-direct price.\n\nIn the end, I am satisfied that the bags are, in fact, filled with a synthetic filament as advertised EVEN THOUGH the tag says cotton. In light of this and the outstanding customer service I received, I have changed my review to 5/5 stars.\n\n***\nOriginal review 12/10/15\nAs I have seen a couple other commenters mention, these sleeping bags are NOT filled with some hollow synthetic material. They are filled with cotton. It states this clearly on the tag. That's a pretty major discrepancy between the product described and the product received.\n\nAnother possible downside is that the filling seemed...patchy. Like it was uniformly distributed throughout the bag. However, they may be because I had just taken out of the stuff sack for (presumably) the first time since it was manufactured, and it just needed a bit of fluffing. I don't know; I didn't try to fluff it. Considering that the sleeping bag is only rated for 35 degrees F, it may just not have that much loft. It seemed warm enough for such temperatures, but I wouldn't push my luck by trying to use it down to freezing.\n\nI have not properly field tested this yet, as my wife and I each got one (the colors and zipper orientations are accurate, at least) for a future-dated camping trip. However, the stitching and zippers seem of good quality to me. I especially like the no-bind device on the zipper, which keeps the sleeping bag fabric from getting caught up and jamming.\n\nI'm pretty short (5' 5''), but there's plenty of extra space in the foot of the bag to stuff gear, etc. if need be for me. It felt like there was enough room to bed down comfortably for a grown man of average height and weight. The doubles option of zipping the two complementary sleeping bags together to make a spoony sack is pretty neat, and suggests that this product is geared more toward couples with a fairly casual interest in camping a few times a year rather than serious outdoorspeople. Fortunately for me and my wife, that's us to a T.\n\nThe stuff sack works well, and I had no trouble getting the sleeping bag down to its originally packed size. It was a a bit lumpier than it was from the factory, but certainly no larger.\n\nOverall, I think this makes a good temperate weather sleeping bag for someone who needs something servicable and affordable. Frankly, I would be giving it at least four stars and maybe five if it weren't for the misadvertisement of the filling.", "summary": "Fine sleeping bag, but filled with cotton", "unixReviewTime": 1450656000}

INSIST ON GETTING THE CHEST STRAP--it is reliable.\n\nSome history: I originally was interested in the Sole treadmill with 3 horse power because Consumer Reports suggested that the F63 would not be powerful enough. The Dick's Sporting Goods salesman, an honest man (bless his heart), convinced me that the F63, with a max speed of 12 mph and 15 degrees, was plenty for me (I am 70 years old and weight under 160 lbs).\n\nThe salesman also convinced me to get a 4-year service deal. Normally I don't buy such service contracts but I did this time, given that I intend to use the machine every day for one hour. The cost was $200.\n\nAll in all, after 2 weeks, I wish I had bought the machine years ago instead of getting my exercise biking outdoors.", "summary": "The F63 is an excellent value", "unixReviewTime": 1294272000}

Because I used this on aluminum, I had to prep by using a self-etching primer. Using the advice from other customer reviews, I used a little bit of paint tint to darken the gray color slightly. The paint came out darker, yet still had the bluish tint mentioned by other reviews. As said by others', it's crucial to mix this paint thoroughly, otherwise the micro-beads will not be consistent.\n  I applied two coats of paint by use of a roller, which came out very smooth and consistent. I was surprised by how thin the paint rolls out for having \"grit\" in it. A good strategy would be to roll out an area, and go back over it a few minutes later without adding more paint on the roller. I found that this makes the paint more consistent, and distributes the micro-beads a little better. The initial coat did not adhere well in areas where I had applied caulk, but seemed to be fine after applying the second coat. The cure time may be a few days, but each layer was dry to the touch within an hour of application (in about 65 degree weather, in a paint tent).\n  I was pleasantly surprised by the finished appearance. While it didn't completely hide small cracks and imperfections, I am confident that it will grip and hold up well. The only reason I did not rate this paint higher was because it is advertised as a true gray, when in fact it is not; and because it requires some serious mixing for proper application. When you think you have mixed it enough - mix it some more. I would definitely use this product again.", "summary": "A good strategy would be to roll out an area", "unixReviewTime": 1494979200}

Lynch", "reviewText": "Bought the Cold Steel Recon Scout 7 1/2\" blade last fall after a boatload of research on quality survival knives that can do most anything.  Paid about $120 including shipping.  The Recon Scout lives up to the reputation of solid performace, a blade that keeps it's sharpness and overall toughness.  I like the solid sheath which makes it easy to carry on a belt or backpack strap.  I added a sheath (to attach my Leatherman multi-purpose) to the Recon Scout sheath.  The Recon Scout weight is great for chopping wood as well as splitting wood up to about 4\" in diameter.  Trust me when I say I was chopping frozen oak in 5 degree weather this winter with minimal extra effort.  Always use WD-40 when splitting wood as it helps the knife slide through without binding.  Also, always use gloves which absorbs the shock of chopping and may protect your fingers.  Lastly, when splitting wood: always have a solid piece of wood under the wood you are splitting so you do not \"ground\" the knife.  Grounding the knife is the fastest way of chipping the blade.\n\nMore than once the blade flexed as it had to wrap around a knot as I drove the blade through a piece of firewood.\nI notched the blade at the handle so that I could use it for fine cutting (kindling and wood shaving).  The black coating is somewhat worn on the blade due to use but, I kinda of like it.\nThere is no sign of rust and I have been using it (including in the snow), clearing 3\" vines, branches and making campfires.  I try to keep the blade clean, dry and WD-40 the blade after every use and when storing.\nAlways check gear reviews via the nutnfancy website and youtube as the man knows his stuff.\nI might get the larger Cold Steel Trailmaster 9 1/2\" blade this fall as I would like to cut larger firewood but this knife is so comfortable to carry.\nI spend a lot of time in the woods alone and with the Recon Scout I know that there is not a problem I can't handle with any animal short of a bear.  From a survival standpoint, the Recon Scout and a fire starter is all I need to handle a day or a night in the woods.\nVery impressed with the Cold Steel product line after getting the Recon Scout.", "summary": "The Cold Steel Recon Scout Rocks!", "unixReviewTime": 1313971200}

I also prefer a heavy 18 plus grain pellet. Thanks for reading and good shooting to everyone.

After doing research, including reading some of the reviews in here, we decided these were an acceptable money risk - we are budget-ly challenged. I am so glad we bought these. The holes along the stakes allow you to tie a guy line at any point to bury the line deeper to create a sort of 'dead man' anchor but with a stake instead of a special bag you have to dig a hole for, fill and bury. The sand is loosely packed, but we aren't supposed to dig at the campsites. We used these for the big tarp we use and needed something big and strong to take possible wind or someone tripping over a guy line. Last year with wind bursts our tarp guy lines had to be restaked every day - we also had crappy tarp poles that wouldn't stay extended. We put our line at the bottom most hole, and facing the concave side toward the tent, sank the stakes at a 45 degree angle, tops tilting away from the tent. The guy lines went right into the sand, and the stake was buried almost to the top. We did have one stake that bent slightly, but we later discovered there was a tree root underneath...that stake is now covered in pine sap, ick, the stake went right through the root. They held all weekend, were easy to pull out and since we bought 2 sets, we were able to use these to guy line our new lovely Kelty tarp poles as well :) Investing in good camping gear is a must if you plan on camping often, or even just once a year. Good dependable gear that can make or break the trip.\n\nSeptember 18, 2012. I see I forgot to mention that these stakes are very lightweight, almost feels like holding air. 8 stakes hardly weight anything! I have read other reviews since some on serious camper sites, some from folks who used them for Burning Man, where the winds can gust up to 50 or 60 without storms.", "summary": "GREAT for loosely packed sand", "unixReviewTime": 1345420800}

Comes with sturdy steaks for weather and wind...not the little flimsy ones that bend in half when you barely hit them. Going to have lots of good adventures with this cabin tent. Great for family or you and your hunting buddy to have two air mattress on either side and all your gear inside safe and dry.  I went with a friend on a mountain bike trip last week and it rained for two days straight.

Self-massagers have been historically disappointing, but after a hard day, I'm always tempted to try yet another one to see if it will actually help out with back and shoulder aches.\nAfter having this for a week or so, I think I have more complaints about it than accolade. First, the product description seems to imply that you can use this product on your own. I tried, and I found that solo operation is both ridiculous looking and feeling. Because of the length of the item, I found that I cannot get it to roll down my back at any comfortable angle. I think this would only be possible were one a contortionist and able to dislocate one or both shoulders. I also found that, solo, I cannot apply the pressure I need.\n\nAnother complaint has to do with the \"customizability\" of the product: it's just... not, really. While you can certainly remove some or even most of the rings, there is nothing on the rod that will set the place of the remaining rings, causing them to move around haphazardly while the product is in use. There *is* a small bit of friction, but there is not a \"ring lock\" or anything like that.\n\nYet another complaint involves the structure of the ring-holding rod: it's basically plastic, and not even particularly hard plastic. You can bend this thing pretty easily. Imagine trying to roll a lump of dough with a 2-foot section of steel cable or thin PVC pipe: it flattens the very top of the dough, but then bows out in the middle and compresses on the ends, still leaving a rounded section in the middle of the dough lump. The malleability of the rod essentially makes it impossible to apply the pressure I need to my back and shoulders -- I can't roll out the lumps in my muscles well enough, or evenly enough.\n\nAnother: the exercise guide that the product description says the item contains is actually downloadable content, not an actual book or leaflet: so, when you receive the item, there will be yet more to do. And if you're like me, you won't even download the guide, but rather just start using the product on its own.\n\nThe one positive is that the product, for what it is, actually feels relatively nice -- better than nothing at all, certainly -- IF you have someone else helping you out. But it's not a miracle massager by any means, as I hope this review has shown. Unless you're super sore, don't expect to melt into a puddle with the Gaiam.", "summary": "Another disappointing muscle massage product", "unixReviewTime": 1444953600}

However the blade would not lock open posing a serious safety threat.  In the Amazon product description it states \"Lifetime Warranty\" so I thought I'd give the system a chance and get a new one.  However at the bottom of the documentation that came with the knife it say \"please don't hesitate to contact us...\" but no contact information was included whatsoever.  Kinda silly I guess.  I poked around Amazon looking for a place to fulfill th lifetime warranty and there wasn't any to be found.  No choice but to return it.\n\nUpdate\nTradewind Products really went out of their way to contact me and do everything possible to make sure I have a more than satisfactory experience.  They got a new knife to me and it's in perfect working order.  Great customer service.\n\nNow to the knife;\nI always carry an EDC knife but one thing that I could use frequently is a flashlight.  This was one of the selling points for me.  It's bright enough for what I need to do but as it's held in place by a magnet and I am a little concerned that it may inadvertently fall out one of these days.  That being said, Tradewind is very serious about their customer's satisfaction and I'm sure they would replace it.\n\nThe Knife is lightweight relative to my leatherman which is a feature I like.  Of course my leatherman has more utility but at the expense of more weight.\n\nThe seat belt cutter and window punch is always a good feature to have in your pocket.  The blade is certainly sharp enough.\n\nTo summarize; good purchase and great customer service.", "summary": "I received the knife and it has some cool things going on", "unixReviewTime": 1423353600}

This is a perfect sizing to have my spinning bike on. The mat protects my tile while keeping my bike secured when I am spinning on it. It is excellent for treadmills and cross country exercisers. It is actually quite thick. I noticed while looking at other mats, many of the customers mentioned that they were extremely thin. This mat is a nice heavy duty thickness. The mat dampens the vibration that can cause wear and tear to your equipment. Riding my bike on this particular mat makes for better balance and absorption to keep my bike in perfect condition.

The waist does not have a particularly \"high back\" cycling cut, the are cut a bit more like skiing pants. However, the waist is fairly high on me so coverage in cold weather shouldn't be an issue. The logos and stitching are reflective. The pants seem decidedly warm, I don't think you'll need tights under them if you're putting out a bit of effort.

I wish I'd gotten a chance to try one of these before ordering. It has a nice design in terms of looks, but I'm always unsure whether the lid has actually sealed all the way shut. It takes a great deal of effort using two hands and lots of focus to ensure that it has. Great style. Very poor function.\n\nAfter MUCH research, I HIGHLY recommend this water bottle alternative: CamelBak Eddy Water Bottle (I don't own the insulated one on Amazon). I own and LOVE the .6 Liter myself, which I got from the LL Bean website for $14. It's a little on the smaller size at 0.6L, but it also comes in larger sizes as well that utilize the high-flow bite straw, which delivers a lot of water with only using one hand and does not spill or leak. Google \"CamelBak Eddy Water Bottle\" and you'll find it. It took just a little getting used to the straw, but I absolutely wouldn't use any other water bottle now.\n\nWhatever you do, avoid this Nalgene On The Fly Water Bottle at all costs.\n\nEDIT (08/10/2013): Someone informed me in a comment that they also had trouble closing the lid of their RED/WHITE bottle, but other colors worked really well.

It has a deep penetrating action to reach every part of the chain. It even comes with a thin tube that fits into nozzle to apply a few drops to the chain.

It does not leave behind a layer of grease to collect and hold dirt and sand and act as an abrasive to the bikes chain and gear system.\n\nTri-flow reduces chain and gear cog wear. It is also great for the rear derailleur to maintain crisp and accurate gear changes and to keep all of the components moving smoothly. It also works on the front derailleur system the same way.\n\nTri-flow contains petroleum lubricants and Teflon particles so make sure to shake it well before you use it.

Figured I'd just learn to deal with it. But the paddle was just too large for my body. It's a fairly rigid paddle and doesn't flex much to the shape of your body, and I've got about a 32-inch waist.\n\nI think most people will love this holster. It's a helluva value, comes with all kinds of adjustability, and you can see from the positive reviews that it fits most people. However, I just wanted to add a review that warns fit/skinny guys that the paddle is a little on the large side. I've attached some pictures comparing the BlackHawk paddle size with my favorite Fobus paddle holster. You can see that the Fobus paddle is more compact. Also note that the Fobus features a grippy rubbery insert that keeps the paddle in place. The BlackHawk doesn't feature this, but it does have a tooth that digs into your pants and locks under your belt to provide pant retention.\n\nUnfortunately, this model Fobus holster isn't available for the large-frame Glocks.

Much bigger than i thought it was. Arrived quickly. A few issues that  cant really be complained about for the price. One, the cushions on the clamp are not fixed, just pressed on probably by hand  and do not stay on under clamping pressure. I had to glue them and clamp them amd now they seem to be there for good. Two, the arm the clamp is on slides into a plastic ring assembly  on the main  body. The arm is smoothish metal, and the ring is smooth plastic. It tighetens with one or two hex screws that mate up with hex nuts in hex recesses on the other side in a raised tab. Be careful with the nuts, they will fall  out if you aren't careful and you could lose them, and not be able  to  tighent the ring. It might  be  a  good  idea  to  glue them in place. But, it doesnt tighten down enough to hold the bike in position at any point other than the bikes balance point. The fix for this is this: shimming. You could use inner tube, but the tolerance is pretty tight and it might not fit amd even if it does, it might bite through the rubber, defeating your purpose. I bought plumbimg Teflon  tape and Duck brand self fusing repair tape. I tried the repair tape  first and it has seemed to work so far, it gives a little, but held a 30 lb dumbell solid with me torqing it and im big and strong. The clamp is plastic amd honestly, i wouldnt give it a lot of sun, it might get brittle on you. The quick releases are a little coarsely threaded, making adjusments effective but tricky. The steel is sturdy and the legs are stable at various extensions and at the fullest  they are wide, but unobtrusive. Dont drop anything  on them or step or stand on them, they may warp or break easily. The feet fold flat for balancing and flip up for storage. The clamp hace a little bit of side to side play in it and the retaining screw doesnt tighten down enough  to take up the slop, but i don't know of this will be a problem.  The stand is rated to 66 lbs, i think it will handle that, but of there is a breakage, it will the in the clamp, or the ring that hold it on the body as both are structurally  plastic of some sort. I would not put much more that in it. This says portable, and if you plan to move it by car, it will fit in all but the smallest trunks or back seats, but the fix for the shifting clamp arm basically makes the clamp arm unremovable, so if you do it that way, ot womt fit in as small a space as if you could take it out. The handlebar stabilizer arm is the lowest quality part of  this and even then, its pretty  good, but should be cared for and not subjected to stess as it will bend or break  easily. The straps that allow it to attach to something  work  but the holes that slip around the stud on the other side of the endcap are a little bit stiff, so reaming them out to loosen  them just a little bit will ease their use. Its probably  easier  and better to load the stand by parking the bike in front of it, then lower the clamp down to the top tube, seat tube or post, or the down tube (probably not the best way to hold a bike in this stand, too top heavy unless you have it inverted) , then put the bike in the clamp, then tighten it moderately, then lift the bike  off the ground with your back to the bike and the clamp arm on your shoulder (if you have a heavy bike, if not you can just lift it, or load it in the clamp with it where you want it),  so you can tighten  the quick release clamp to hold the rising arm at the height  you want it. This is perhaps a little easier than trying to put the bike in the clamp and tighten it, since the clamp can require two hands since it is sprinf tensioned  and it is counter tightened with a wing nut.  As far as working on a bike on it, you should take care not to over torque things while the bike is on the stand suspended. You should  break bolts loose before you have it in the stand, then load it, do what you need to do, finger tighten, remove and apply finishing torque on the ground. This is simply because of the plastic clamp and ring issues. Its not a park tool or topeak or pedros, but you aren't paying even half of what those cost, if you need heavy duty and three sigma engineering, you should expect to pay for that, this isn't  that, this is a budget basic work stand and thats the price you are  paying. One more thing,  the tool tray is a sorta nice touch but even at this price, it could have been better done. It is two pieces, main tray body with a magnet (small, good for keeping screws where you want them, but not much more than that) and a bracket that holds it to the stand by clampimg it to the main member. The bracket attaches with two hex screws. The threading is so fine it takes about two and a half weeks to screw or unscrew them with the thankfully supplied hex driver. A simple spring tensioned  clamp would make more sense with something that is supposed to be portable, but the tray is a half moon, so it's  possible  to loosen the screws to let it rotate around and let the stand lay flat for transport of storage. The stamd will also store easily under a bed or other higher standing furniture, or a closet or corner.\n If you want to solve the clamp arm rotation  problem without making the arm permanently attached to the stand i just figured out  a way to do that. Get the larger  work clamps you use for holding glued pieces together the kind that have a screw or trigger  tightening mechanism and one clamp arm is fixed  and the other slides along a long rail. Tighten one clamp onto the stands clamp arm on the end that sticks out of the ring after you insert it through. The rail should be on the side that you are trying to prevent motion in. Using another or two other clamps tightly around  the stands vertical  main main tube so that the rail or rails brace the rail from the first, preventing it from rotating.  This will allow you  to use  the stand and not have to worry about the bike roating. Hope this iI'ms helpful\n\n Update 6-24-16. Reducing to three after using the thing. Its sturdy, and the base is stable. The clamp though renders unusabale. Its unstable and hard to use and comes unclamped or the clamp arm srill shifting even after making modifications to it. I woild not reccomend this unless you are working on a lot of kids bikes or you like buying inexpensove stuff that neds finishing. The entire stand is great except the clamp thst holds the bike.the tray is useful amd hold the tools you pit in it. . So if you are looking for something like this topeak or park tool might be the way to go.", "summary": "You get ehat you pay for and you don't get what you don't pay for. Hard to beat for the price.

It also helps to use a lighter to soften the plastic and remove some of the tension on the paddle, although I can't say how much I might have weakened the paddle in doing so.  Incidentally, relieving the tension also allows the grip of the gun to sit a little closer to the body (about 1/4\") and print a bit less in CCW.\n\nIt would be nice if Blackhawk could invent a quick-release feature for their SERPA holsters that didn't add 1/2\" to the width of the holster, since that makes it difficult to carry concealed.", "summary": "Needs some tweaks for civilian CCW", "unixReviewTime": 1396742400}

In the past, my umbrella simply did not have the support that I would have liked, but short of using bricks or concrete blocks, I couldn't find something that worked really well. The large canopy weight bags by Best Outdoor Canopy Weight are a great solution for not only umbrella stands but many other items. Of course, as the name implies these bags are ideal for use with a large canopy, and in this review I'll address how good the are for both use with an umbrella and a canopy.\n\nLet me start with a disclaimer required by Amazon: I received these bags for reduced cost in exchange Karen honest and unbiased opinion. In my case, that means I put the product to normal use  and in cases like these bags  and many times to an extended use. I include these uses in my commentary as well as any problems I may have experienced.\n\nNow that I have that out of the way I can return to what I use the bags for and how I use them. The bags arrived on a Thursday afternoon just in time for a Saturday afternoon family get together. It was a beautiful day and we decided to eat outside. We fired up the gas grill, and I had one of my sons and another guest set up the table with the umbrella. As I noted in my opening, we have had problems finding the right arrangement for our umbrella and the reason for that is that the table is made in my shop but the umbrella was purchased at a local box store. There was no real stand with the umbrella which meant that from time to time a breeze of 5 mph or more could rattle the umbrella in its place or even lift it from the center of the table.\n\nOn this day, I had my son use a single set of the canopy weight bags and he quickly figured out how to use them with some spare sand from a patio project and the bags strong strap system. This is very similar to using them with a canopy, so there is really no stretch of the imagination or use necessary. What the canopy weight bag allowed us to have is an umbrella that was now encased between the two weight compartments and this provided not only the strength necessary to keep the umbrella from rattling on the table but also from trying to rise as the wind picked up in the late afternoon. In fact, we set the canopy/umbrella up in an area that would allow the shadow from the umbrella to cover the nearby sandbox used by my two-year-old grandson. He's a great little-redheaded boy that burns in the sun quite easily so having a product that can help protect him is well worth the five-star rating.\n\nI also participate in a number of local events such as car shows and shooting competitions. Having a canopy often means that you can sit in an area that will block the sun and provide some relief, especially during the high summer months in North Carolina. On this occasion, I took all of the canopy weight bags to the local show where I was parking one of my cars. The canopy was set up, as usual, and now I had some real confidence that it would set in place without having to worry about digging a hole for the legs are trying some other rigged contraption for holding it in place. A number of people coming by car not only enjoyed the engine work but remarked on what a great idea the canopy weight bags were for the canopy. Of course, I told all of them I had received the weight bags on Amazon so they received pretty much the same review that I'm posting here.\n\nLet me finish this review by saying that the quality of these bags is very high. The material used for the weight pockets is relatively thick, with good stitching on the edges and especially where there would be tension. I like the way the whole product was designed. For use, one simply fills the bag was sand or dirt (depending on where you are using it) and slides the pole or leg into place. When used with a canopy you will need all four support bags. If you are using them for a single umbrella or multiple umbrellas then you can use them individually or in groups.", "summary": "Very nice product that works better than expected", "unixReviewTime": 1457395200}
