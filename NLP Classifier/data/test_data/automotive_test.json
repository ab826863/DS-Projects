Not to be outdone, Febreze offers a new air freshener that clips to a vehicle's air vent.\n\nThe liquid Febreze is encased in a compact silver and gray plastic container (measuring about 1\" x 1\" x \") with a straight plastic close-pin type clip on the back, allowing the air freshener to be pushed tightly on to a vent louver. Located on the top edge of this air freshener is a slider that governs the fragrance strength. This is an important feature because the fragrance in this product is strong, so I recommend starting at the lowest setting first or your nose just may go into sensory shock. There are around a half dozen different scents available.\n\nThis air freshener is designed to be used with the aid of the vehicle's air vent. In my opinion, this product works great without a vent. In fact, I found using it with a vent too overwhelming, even at the lowest setting. I ended up putting mine at the lowest setting and placing it in one of the passenger cup holders just behind the center console in my sedan. Perfect! The smell is subtle rather than eye watering, and my air freshener has lasted over twice as long as advertised, too. According to Febreze, this air freshener will last 30 days.\n\nI selected a Febreze air freshener with the \"Meadows and Rain\" scent. Though I can't say the fragrance reminds me of a meadow during or after a rain, I still like the fresh clean scent.\n\nPostscript (14 Jan 2014): I don't know what I am doing right but the air freshener is still producing a subtle scent; a little less than earlier but still a nice fragrance. This Febreze product has definitely performed better than expected. Just keep it at the lowest setting.", "summary": "Febreze Car Vent Clips Air Freshener and Odor Eliminator", "unixReviewTime": 1384041600}

What I mean by this is that discharging a battery and leaving it discharged causes sulfation, but leaving it too low for too long causes irreversible damage.  This device serves to correct sulfation, and I have found this to be true in my experience.\n\nFirst, I use a 1 amp trickle changer and a battery tester that checks voltage and CCA by type of battery.  It does not test under load, but gives a general idea if the battery is bad or not.\n\nI started off with 2 batteries, one a motorcycle SL 260 CCA and, and the other an AMG 760 CCA.\n\nThe motorcycle battery sat at about 8v or less for almost a month. I equalized it, checked the fluid level, and put a trickle charger and desulfator on it.  I was able to bring it back up to hold 11 v for 24hrs and would get about 230 CCA.  After a few days it would be dead again.  Pretty clear indication one of the cells had reversed polarity and the battery is no good, no amount of desulfation can correct this.\n\nThe 760 AH battery on the other hand, had died a couple times and was having a hard time getting and holding a full charge.  It would fall to about 12.4v over the course of a week, and I would get a reading of about 700 CCA.  After about a month and a half on a trickle change with the desulfator, the battery holds at 12.8v and I am getting 770 CCA.\n\nIf you have the patience (and the battery you are trying to restore is not destroyed) this thing is great.  I ordered more for other batteries and friends.  Customer service is top notch, I found one came faulty in the mail.  I reached out to the manufacturer and they sent a brand new one and apologized for the inconvenience.\n\nNote: I have found that hooking this up in parallel with any device that relies on voltage for readings with really screw with things.  I would personally not leave it hooked up on our high end imports that rely on complex and sensitive computer systems.  I would leave it hooked up on my toyota without too much concern.", "summary": "Works on Sulfated Batteries", "unixReviewTime": 1435708800}

These towels are better than the bulk Walmart type (they should be for the cost!) but they are not the luxurious high end towel you might be expecting.

Even went through the trouble of sealing the break line bleed valve with teflon tape when installing the kit drain tubing.\n\nWhen I got started bleeding the breaks from my Vstrom, it started leaking air through the drain oil reservoir and not only was unable to keep a vacuum but instead *injected* air through the motorcycle brake lines (to the point of making air bubbles to boil the oil on the motorcycle brake reservoir, spilling oil over the place).\n\nThe damage wasn't even bigger because I was careful and protected all the area around the gas tank with paper towels before getting started (but otherwise, it would have ruined the gas tank paint as DOT4 fluid damages painted surfaces).\n\nI had to drain the brake lines 4 times using the goodie and oldie method of pumping the brake lever to get ridden of all the air that mityvac introduced into my motorcycle's brakes. Wasted 3x the time to perform a simple operation and could have damaged my motorcycle.\n\nTo add insult to the injury, to return this I had to visit a UPS store and buy a cardboard box (7USD = box + assembly) as the UPS pick up guy refused to receive the kit in its case with no cardboard box. Factor in the cost of gas to drive from my place to the nearby UPS store and you see that this was not only a waste of time but made me loose money. I bought this to save time and not having to ask help while doing a simple maintenance operation.\n\nSearching about the issue, it seem that is quite common for the drain oil reservoir to leak air (and the 'fix' of adding teflon tape around its cover didn't work too).\n\nFinal remark: if you are lucky and got one that is not leaking, you may be happy. But I have the impression that this is like flipping a coin (and I definitely don't like to rely on luck when comes to tools).", "summary": "Great kit: if at least it was able to keep a vacuum!", "unixReviewTime": 1433289600}

This is super-easy to install, and will save you hundreds over going to the dealership and having them do it for you.  What you'll needs is two wheel ramps, a floor jack, ratchet wrench, torque wrench, extension extender (used between the socket and the ratchet wrench), and a 17 millimeter deep socket.  Replacing the engine mount should take 30 - 45 minutes.\n\nThe first thing you'll need to do is drive your car up on the wheel ramps, and then remove the plastic engine cover on the bottom of the car.  Once this is done, place a piece of wood or rubber jack pad on the saddle of the floor jack, and then lift the engine slightly by placing the saddle of the floor jack beneath the oil pan of the engine.  The engine doesn't need to be lifted much, and this will not damage the oil pan.\n\nOnce the engine has been lifted, with the hood raised, remove the clear plastic coolant reservoir, that is over the engine mount.  This reservoir is held in place by two metal clips.  A flat head screwdriver may be needed to help.  After this is done, the only thing left is to remove the two bolts that hold the engine mount to the car, and then the two nuts that hold the engine to the mount; the 17 millimeter socket will be needed for this, and specifically a deep socket will be needed to remove the two nuts.  Before you begin, you may want to place a cloth over the passenger-side fender to make sure you don't chip any paint.\n\nThe engine may shift as you start loosening the nuts and bolts, however the floor jack should hold it in place.  After you've removed the two bolts and nuts, the mount should come out easily, and the new one put in its place.  The engine may need to be lifted some more with the floor jack so that bolts from the engine stick far enough through the mounts to put the nuts on.  Be sure and confirm what the torque settings are for the nuts and bolts; there's plenty of online videos with this information on them to watch.  The coolant reservoir is easy to put back in it's place as well as the plastic engine cover on the bottom of the are.\n\nThis is a very simple process, and anybody who is able to change their own oil can do it, and it'll save you hundreds over having the dealership do it for you.

Attached is a picture of my MX-5 with LED driving lights (center, top, next to the grille,) HID low beams (top, outside,) and the driver's side (bottom right in picture) is this bulb, and opposite it is the original halogen.\n\nIt is difficult to tell in the picture unless you look carefully, but these LEDs are much brighter and produce a much cleaner (cooler) light than the halogens they replaced.  Speaking of \"cool\" - they do not generate much heat at all.  I touched the glass lens on the fog lights, and the LED was cool to the touch, the glass lens in front of the halogen was hot enough to cook an egg.\n\nUnfortunately, for the purposes of picture-taking, it was not possible to turn the fog lamps on without the headlights turned on without completely unplugging everything else, so again, you have to look closely at the picture to tell the difference.  As I stated in other reviews of the same bulbs with different sockets for other vehicles, they simply must be seen to be believed.\n\nEveryone I've shown these bulbs to has been completely blown away, and I've helped several friends to bring their vehicles up-to-date on lighting - find your exact socket and order these lights that fit - these 144 SMD LEDs are unbeatable.", "summary": "Best fog/driving lights I've ever had.", "unixReviewTime": 1472601600}

So I called the original installer who told me to bring it in the next morning, which I did.\n\nIt turns out the button was actually incorporated into the the passenger power window switch on the driver's console! I'm sure that was not pointed out to me on that day it was installed. It took him a few minutes to discover that, then about 10 seconds to program it.

Not a friction hinge, but one with catches so that it's less likely to creep open if you put pressure on the tablet. And it has a release, so that it won't open up unless you take positive action to do so.\n\nSecond, it's beefy enough. The rear leg isn't too narrow, or too wide. It resists torsion And third, it's got some non slip rubber with a bit of lip so that the tablet doesn't go flying. Which is bad.\n\nThe bottom has a recessed area that can allow for an Apple lightning connector to be attached to the bottom and still fit in the stand, without too much strain on the cord. Unfortunately, that isn't so much the case with a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro; the OEM USB end is a bit bigger than Apple's connector, and it hits. So you have to flip the tablet 180 degrees. Not a huge thing, but it might mean this is less suitable for that tablet. On the plus side, even with an Otterbox enclosure on my Tab it fit in the stand securely.

I got blue so I can instantly distinguish my truck key ring from others laying around.

Other than that, it opens and locks the doors just like a GM fob, but at a fraction of the price. As others have noted, programming is easy. My only complaint has to do with the battery. The fob stopped working after about a year. Seemed a short lifespan for a fob battery, esp. for a rig that's not driven too often, but I replaced the battery and that got the fob working again. It went dead again with weeks, so I replaced the battery again, and again it died within weeks. Changing the battery again with one fresh-off-the shelf, I noticed that a tiny LED on the circuit board lit up intermittently as I was sliding the new battery into its holder, sort of a metal cage with one open side and little tabs on top that double as conductors and retainers. I'd also noticed that the old battery was protruding slightly from the open side of the holder before I removed it. I think the battery goes dead so quickly because it gradually nudges out of its cage to where it makes contact with a nearby bit of metal on the circuit board. That lights up the LED, but there must be some other power draw, too. The good news is it doesn't actuate my truck's locks. My fix - I hope, it's only a week old so far - was to use the protective sticker off the new battery to insulate the metal on the circuit board and hold the battery more securely in its cage. Hopefully, the manufacturer will discover and fix this design flaw at some point, because it's otherwise a great deal.", "summary": "Works like original, but battery holder needs improvement", "unixReviewTime": 1468281600}

Why Nissan failed to equip automatic locking free running hubs into all their 4 X 4s that are not all wheel drive is just cheap and dumb.  At least I found a manual locking free running hub that fits perfectly and will likely pay for itself in reduced wear and tear and fuel efficiency.

With a bit of skill and dremel the center of the hub cap can be cut out so that it will fit.

The backing material sewn inside the nylon appears to be cardboard panels, which is typical, but for some reason they seem to be heavier and perhaps denser, which may translate to a structure that may be sturdier.\n\nIf the organizer will just sit in your trunk, a little more reinforcement may not make much difference, unless you do a lot of rough driving.  But if the organizer is in situation where it slides around and is subject to impact, like in the bed of a truck, toughness may become a factor.\n\nHeld together by Velcro type fasteners, putting the parts together takes just a few minutes.  The organizer measures about 21 by 14, and is 12 high.  There are provisions to divide the main compartment into up to three separate sections.  Installing both dividers is not necessary, but having at least one in place keeps the structure stable.\n\nThere are a total of four large net pockets and two covered pockets on the exterior sides, for holding smaller items.  On the bottom of the organizer are Velcro fasteners to help keep the assembly from sliding on a carpeted surface.  Also included is a lid that covers the entire top of the organizer, and a decent sized insulated carry bag as a bonus.\n\nThis heavy duty organizer is one of the larger and tougher ones that I have seen so far.  This model does not appear to be a generic product that is being sold by several sellers.  If you need a larger organizer which is durable, take a look at this one.  The cost is higher, so unless you really need the space or durability, you could probably get by with a less expensive option.", "summary": "a very heavy duty trunk organizer", "unixReviewTime": 1468800000}

A foam gasket is included to reduce rattling.\n\nI thought this emblem, with a 3 height x 3.5 width, would be small, but the striking colors make it conspicuous while the size keeps it subtle. To ensure that this emblem stays on your truck, I would advise getting a keyed receiver lock.

It worked very well.  I am attaching a collage of 5 photos and will be referencing the photos by the unique numbers that each photo was labelled with.\n\n1) The stock photo is somewhat deceiving as it makes you think the clay fills the nice container it is shipped in. Photo #1 shows the clay in the plastic wrap is it arrived, and photo #2 a clay ball after I worked with it.  The amount of clay is sufficient to work with, I am not complaining about that, just the photo makes you think you get a lot more.  The container itself is very nice for storage.  The paint clay I used before is Mother's clay - love the product - but I had to come up with a plastic container of my own.  A tip on storage: before storing the clay ball in the container wet the outside of the clay ball with Griot's Speed Shine or any other detailing spray. This makes the clay easier to take out the next time as it sticks less to the container.\n\n2) Photos #4 and #5 show the windshield glass before and after.  As you can see the difference is significant, and it was fairly easy to get it that clean.  All glass surfaces took no more than 20 minutes and that included taking photos for this review.  The clay removed water stains as well as some non-bird droppings (I think dragonfly or some other insect) which are hard to remove with just soap and water.\n\n3) Photo #3 shows the trick that allows me to reach the glass that it too far away for me to reach by hand.  I am fairly short so reaching the middle of the sunroof and the middle of my windshield is not possible for me without a stepping stool.  I found that it was a lot easier to to put the clay ball under a triangle-shaped&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Glass-Reach-and-Clean-Tool/dp/B0017K69MA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Glass Reach and Clean Tool</a>&nbsp;and use it to rub the clay ball on the glass that I could not reach.\n\nThe clay worked well to remove debris, but it was fairly sticky and my hands were slightly blue when I finished.  I was able to remove the residue from my hands using Griot's Speed Shine followed by a vigorous washing with soap.\n\nThumbs up overall!\n\nAli Julia review", "summary": "Works well, before and after photos attached", "unixReviewTime": 1339891200}

I actually use a pair in the back yard on a motion detector and 12V landscaping power supply. If someone walks around the yard, they get blinded by these puppies.\n\nThe part on the bottom of the light where the mounting hardware is attached can be moved left or right, then locked in place with two Allen screws (wrench included.)  This gives you more mounting options and is a pretty handy feature.  All the hardware (except the Allen screws) is Stainless steel, the housings Aluminum, and the lens and reflector, plastic.\n\nI measured the draw, and each light pulls 1 amp.

It works, but it usually constantly bumps the winch as if you're tapping the button, when you are in fact holding the button down. You can hear the contactor smashing off and on repeatedly.

I emailed warn about it and all they said was move the receiver to an open location. But with the hood open, it is in an open location, and it still barely works from 20 feet away. Also moving the receiver would mean that I would have to move my winch contactor, because the receiver plugs into the contactor box. I can't do that, because I spent hundreds of dollars on 1/0 cable and spent hours relocating the contactor up high in the engine bay to keep it out of water. I had to weld some mounts for it into the side of the fender under the hood. It would take me hours and more wiring to relocate it again, that ain't happenin. It wouldn't matter anyway since it still doesn't work with the hood open unless I hold the remote up high in the air and pointed directly at it. When you're trying to direct a complicated and dynamic recovery with multiple snatch blocks you can not concentrate on standing there pointing the remote in the exact right spot to get it to work!

It is exactly like the original alternator I took off the car with the exception of a denso sticker in place of the honda sticker (with denso written on it as well). I also believe it's the identical unit from the oem manufacturer because the unit I got was from amazon warehouse for forty two dollars and I was able to use a part off the old alternator on this one. The condition was described as \"used-like new.\" When I received the alternator, it was indeed in new condition, but the positive terminal that connects the alternator to the battery was bent, and the plastic housing around the terminal was shattered. I suppose someone dropped it on the terminal at some point. Anyhow, I was able to take the cover off the original alternator and screw it onto this one, thus allowing me to connect the rubber boot over the positive terminal. Unit works perfectly, although I only have about 100 miles on it so far. It's exceedingly well built. So well, in fact, that after examining it, I felt safe putting it in my car despite suspecting someone dropped it. My original oem alternator for my 2003 accord 4 cylinder, which is also a denso, was still working, but I'm a preventive maintenance guy. There was no core charge so I still  have the old alternator as a spare. Will probably put new brushes in it. My 2003 accord coupe 4 cylinder manual has 110,000 miles on it. Next up is the water pump! This is a great product, and I got a steal from amazon warehouse. Very satisfied. Even if you pay regular price, this is the best option. The denso alternators appear to last forever. Atleast that's what the people in the honda forums say.\n\nI wanted to add some comments regarding installation. It is fairly easy for the accord coupe 4 cylinder that I have. The tools you need are a serpentine belt bar tool, a 14mm socket, a 12mm socket (with extension or deep socket) 10mm wrench or socket, and a socket wrench (I used a flex head which made reaching bottom bolts easier). Obviously you disconnect the battery. Use a 14mm socket and serpentine belt tool on the tensioner to remove the serpentine belt (push towards the front of the car on the serpentine belt tool). Then on to the alternator. Once you get the 3 retaining bolts unscrewed with a 12mm socket, you need to disconnect the wiring harness and the positive terminal with a 10mm wrench or socket. It's actually easier to disconnect the bolts, then hold the alternator and use a 10mm socket (especially true when reinstalling) on the positive terminal. To get the alternator out, you should pull up on your power steering fluid reservoir and move it back towards the engine a bit, and do the same for the electrical fitting attached to the radiator. Just detach from the radiator to give you more room for extraction. Slide the detached alternator under the A/C line (you will need to push the line towards the engine) and it just comes on out of there. When reinstalling, attach the top bolt first but leave it loose, then you can move the alternator to give you enough room to use a socket wrench on the positive terminal (it's a tight fit if you install alternator and then attempt to secure the bolt). Then bolt on the bottom two retaining bolts using your 12mm socket. Torque the 12mm retaining bolts in to 192 in/lbs or 16 ft/lbs with a torque wrench. Reattach the serpentine belt and you're good.", "summary": "Fantastic alternator from Honda OEM manufacturer for alternators", "unixReviewTime": 1426464000}

I purchased LED taillight upgrades you'll see in the photo that have a reflecter sticking out on the side slightly farther than the stock rear light housings. I would worried this wouldn't fit but they have enough space and even wrap around for a larger caged look.\n\n INSTALLATION\n It only took me about five minutes to install these alone.  With another person helping you this may take only a minute. The hardest part was just balancing it to get the first screw going. It fits right in line with the stock location and housing. No extra drill holes or anything crazy like that are needed.  Screws are provided with a little extra length to make up for the added width of the guard. I like how the don't directly touch the light and there is some room to absorb a hit in case something hits the guard (it shouldn't transfer the blast to the light cracking it). Enjoy the photos as I am pleased. They are as steady as the housing was without the guard in place so the extended screws didn't jeopardize the light housing installation integrity. The product is heavy and not cheap tin foil. I appreciate the curved bar engineering that looks like it can absorb a blast similar to metal bars underneath an airline seat for crash landings.\n\nPRICE\n$-$$ out of $$$$$ based on the seller I went with.

With that said, I have had my Superwinch Tiger Shark 9500 for exactly 1 year as of this review. I have used it to rescue myself 5 times and to help others about the same. The most I have used it was on Pritchett Canyon in Moab Utah. I used it on Axle Hill, Rock Pile, and Chewy. I used it at Cleveland Rock on the Holy Cross Trail in Colorado to name just a few places.  A little note on reliability. We had 4 rigs on Pritchett Canyon with 4 different brand of winches. Our trail leader had a Warm winch but I am not sure of the model, my Uncle has a Ramsey REP8000, my brother has a Smittybilt XRC-9.5, and of course my Superwinch Tiger Shark 9500. By the end of the day only tje Warn and my Superwinch had not malfunctioned or quit. The Smittybilt stopped free spooling requiring it to be powered out. The Ramsey was having control box or remote issues and intermittently worked.\nSo what are the pro's and con's?\n\nPro's: All stainless hardware, water proof construction, heavy-duty drive train, Superwinch quality control, safety circuit breakers included, waterproof remote, easy to use clutch, lowest amp draw un it's class, Price!!!.\n\nCon's: Made in China, slow no load line speed, 10 pounds heavier then a Warn M8000, no lifetime warranty.\n\nIn my judgement, I believe the pro's outweighed the con's.

The problem with this antenna kit are the adapters, specifically the small adapter required for the factory Ford antenna base.  If the adapters were made out of a decent qualit and properly heat treated steel or stainless steel it wouldn't be a problem but you can see in the photo that the adapter sheared off and that was without much torque at all.  I put some blue Loctite on the threads of the adapter and applied minimal torque but adapter sheared off.  The diameter of the shank is about .100\" and with such poor steel it simply can't stand up to the necessary torque to properly secure the antenna.  To fix this issue I used an appropriately sized drill bit to drill out the factory antenna base and then cut threads in the base with a 1/4-20 tap. I then used the 1/4-20 adapter in the kit to attach the new antenna.  It was very easy to drill out the sheared off stub that was stuck in the factory base which tells me that the steel is very soft.  Once I got the antenna mounted I'm pleased with the results.  Radio reception is good, the antenna looks factory, and the truck fits in the garage.  I took two stars off this product due to the poor quality of the adapters.", "summary": "Antenna is fine but the adapters are of poor quality, particularly the smaller diameter ones.", "unixReviewTime": 1531699200}

The operating manual included was a bit skimpy but sufficient.\n\nI like the size a feel of the unit.  The cord to plug into a 110 VAC outlet for power is a bit short though.  You'll no doubt need an extension cord to place it near the battery if you are charging one in a vehicle.\n\nCharging the battery is done via 2 large alligator clamps.  I charged a mostly dead 12 VDC auto battery over night and it now works perfectly.  This is not a fast charge unit nor will it work to jump-start a vehicle with a dead battery.\n\nYou choose the battery type, voltage etc but pressing a series of buttons and watching the LEDs to select the correct settings.\n\nI found the unit very useful.", "summary": "Good Buy", "unixReviewTime": 1406851200}

You can see this by searching my reviews. This product was given to me in trade for a HONEST review, and that is what you will get.\n\nI am a profesional controls Steamfitter, which I have to rely on my meters to be perfect. So this review will be based on over 30 years of experience in the trades.\n\nI agree with the other reviews given, a small case to hold the pieces would be nice, but would add cost, I have many cases for holding these so it is not a big deal to me. The leads them self are more for a amateur or home owner for tinkering around. Running the leads through several test and comparing them to Fluke leads as I use mostly Fluke meters.\n\nResistance using my Fluke 789 ($1000 meter) and a Fluke 87 ($400 meter) Fluke probes = 0.0 ohms, while these leads were 0.2 ohms. This is normal on lighter gauge wires. It also only matters for taking professional reading, home owners would not see an issue.\n\nWire gauge - Using a digit caliper, I tested the wire is several locations and come up with 2.54 mm(.100\"). The claims were 2.8 mm. The Fluke leads in comparison are 3.58 mm (.141\").  The ends are threaded which makes it fairly easy to take and switch ends to/from probes or alligator clips. This makes it nice if you wish to get a quick jumper wire. Quality of the insulation is very good, and passed a 600 volt meg ohm meter test, but I would not grade them as Class 3. (see photos)\n\nLead ends - The cute alligator clips cover up the threaded ends making it hard to put on the leads. The probe end is 2.0 mm as stated but the length is 22.5 mm and not the 18 mm as stated. Again, this is not a big deal, just being exact.\n\nMeter lead end - This was a disappointment as they were loose in my older Fluke 87, but OK in the Fluke 789. They also leave exposed metal even when seated all the way in. This could lead to a dangerous condition when reading high voltage. ( see photos )\n\nSo - are these \"the best multimeter test leads\"? Compared to the ones that come with a $30 meter, they are better. Compare to what we use on higher end instruments, not even close. With that said.... Do you need to spend $60 on test leads for you home projects? No, not at all. These will work fine and the wire quality is more important making them a good value for the money.\n\nNow the reason for 4 stars - Exposed metal at meter on leads, alligator screw ends should have been longer - insulations not covering screws. It was thinking closer to 3 stars, but these are again for amateurs, not professionals.", "summary": "which I have to rely on my meters to be perfect.

Anyone experienced with jeeps and mechanics won't have a problem but I can see where someone without experience and a good tool set could have issues installing it.  Better instructions for novices would be an improvement.  It seems to me that many of the companies making aftermarket Jeep parts have great products but don't know how to write up decent procedures.\n\nHaving an extensive tool set and plenty of wrenching experience, it was just a matter of removing a bunch of nuts and bolts (along with the transfer case skid plate, front cross bar and cross member), installing the two mounting brackets and the plate, and then reassembling everything.  The clearance between the transmission pan and the exhaust is really tight.  I used a persuader (3 lb. mallet).  Oh, and you need to support the transfer case with a jack before removing the cross member.  Failing to do this could result in flattened body parts.\n\nAll in all the skid is high quality, looks good and should protect the trans pan and cooling line.

Below is my experience.\n\nI'm learning to ride a motorcycle and this is my first motorcycle helmet and, not going to lie, I felt overwhelmed by the number of choices. I chose this helmet because a friend of mine, who is a gear head and whom I trust, purchased this helmet for himself. I measured my head and, despite the reviews complaining of sizing issues, purchased the helmet that matched the HJC sizing guide. It arrived on time, and I couldn't wait to put it on. It was very tight that first time, so tight I even wondered that first day whether I had gotten too small a size, but at my wife's advising, I decided to give it a couple more days to break in. I wore it a few times while watching Netflix to get used to the feel and finally got to take it for it's maiden ride as a passenger on the back of another friend's motorcycle. During this ride, he wore my other friends HJC helmet just to compare to his cheap Walmart helmet. \"A helmet is a helmet\" he said. \"Why should I pay more?\" At the end of this ride, I had no more doubts. There was almost no wind noise and the ventilation was very cooling. I could actually feel the air hitting my head through the vents. The fogging, which I thought might be a problem, was not an issue at all out on the road, and at times, the helmet was so comfortable, I hardly noticed I was even wearing it. Another interesting thing, though, happened at the end of this ride. My friend I had rode with, who had the cheap Walmart helmet, promptly went into the house, logged in to Amazon, and purchased an HJC helmet for himself. As it stands, in my group of six close friends, four of us now own this exact model HJC helmet, and my wife has requested that I purchase this helmet for her when I'm ready to put her on the back of my bike.\n\nMy advice, buy this helmet with confidence.", "summary": "My advice, buy this helmet with confidence.", "unixReviewTime": 1466553600}

It may create too much of a suction and may break a seal or something.  As the container fills up, there is less empty room in the container so it will require less pumping.  Eventually all of your oil will come out.  I sucked up about 6.8 liters of old oil.  It was very easy to do and was actually pretty fun.  While it's sucking the oil out, you can change the oil filter.  Build, seems to be of qood build quality. The only thing I didn't like so much is the tubing.  I wish the connecting gommet was something different.  Maybe a screw like connector would be better.

Quality control and construction is lacking from what I could see, perhaps why the first person returned them to amazon? Anyway, there's stray stitching and string on all pieces, the ends aren't all finished very well either. While installing I pulled on the strap to connect the ends and it ripped through the seat with what I would consider an acceptable amount of force to pull the seat tight enough.\n\nSo now I have the seat covers installed but the head rest covers won't fit. I do have a 2012 and I guess the head rests have changed enough to not allow them to fit. I guess it would be nice if Rugged Ridge had a working website to indicate which products work on the 2011 + 2012s as it seems many of their products still list \"07 and up\" rather than the real limits. With the new model out for so long now I'd hope they could at least keep their customers happy by such a simple thing as validating and testing.\n\nThey look pretty decent but I don't think I'd say fits like it was re-upholstered... If you've got a 2011/2012 I'd avoid this one and try to find a brand that is designed properly and hopefully has better quality control. I'm likely to keep checking myself and maybe gift these to someone who has an older model that might fit properly.", "summary": "Glad it was cheap", "unixReviewTime": 1324598400}

Well, I followed YouTube and the manufacturer instructions. It was easy to install except the green wire from the left tail light to the right was pretty short.

After 5 minutes on the road I stopped to ensure it was operational and the right tail light stopped working. inspected all wires and tested with volt meter and the right tail light of the 4-way flat T-connector failed to function but the left light was working correctly. Used jumpers to test trailer light and all lights including the right tail light are functional. investigated potential wire failures - there were none. I cut the unit out and sent it back to Amazon as a defective item and ordered a 2nd unit. The package said Curt tests every unit before resale, they failed to properly test this one. Both my Dodge and the trailer have LED lights.\n2. It's been 1 hr of driving and the 2nd one is still working. There are still 2 issues regarding install, the green wire from the left taillight to the right taillight needs to be longer and the sticky pad for mounting the unit needs to be larger. I used carpet tape to mount mine\n08/18/17: the unit failed within 6 months and customer service was no help. they blamed the failure on my vehicle; however, my vehicle is performing just fine when i remove the fuse from the wiring harness.

So far performance of the fans is identical to the original equipment.

Actually screwing them in serves no purpose but to spin a screwdriver.\n\nThe bug shield I received is just a bit wavy and warped in the middle.

Simple, effective.  I wanted something to poll sensors in order to verify sensor IDs and troubleshoot issues.  I also wanted it to activate dormant sensors.  So, I decided to go with ATEQ's product that matched these requirements, the VT-30.\n\nWell, it didn't go that way.  My first impressions of the device were that it feels like it was made by fisher price.  It's very light for its size, and the buttons are plastc covered, but not in a good way.  They're also not very responsive.  It comes in a silicone case that seems it would do a decent job in a fall, but overall it feels cheap.  For the price, I expected more solidity in the build.\n\nAt this point, I was willing to overlook this.  I'm a diy'er, not a professional mechanic.  If it works, it works.  I tried it on my car.  It read the first couple sensors first try with no problems.  After that, it went down hill.  It never read another sensor again.  It would simply say no sensor detected.  I tried various positions, various angles, rain dances, etc which were not required to make it work before.  No dice.\n\nSo, I tried updating it.  Installing the software was easy enough.  When it went to update, the device would simply shut off and the software would say it is incompatible.  Per the reviews here, I found you had to hold the enter button, then hit the power button to turn it on in order to put it in a boot loader mode for updates.  Nowhere in the software or any other documentation is that ever mentioned, but there you go.\n\nAfter updating, it still wouldn't work.  I tried it on the two sensors it managed to read before, nope.  I tried it on my winter set, nope.  I tried it on the wife's car (also a Subaru), nope.  I boxed it back up and sent it back.  I couldn't get it out the door fast enough.\n\nBottom line:  For the price, it feels cheap and is extremely flakey.  Maybe I got a bad one, but it worked and then it didn't.  The next one could do that a month in instead of 45 seconds.  Not a good track record to appease me.\n\nI ordered an Autel and it worked perfectly and is still working.  It also has a rechargeable Li-Ion battery instead of a 9v.  The only downside is Autel only gives you a year of updates, which doesn't matter to me since it works on our cars now.

The idea is that every modern vehicle has an On-Board Diagnostics II (OBD II) port.  The port is usually located near the drivers left knee, sometimes under a cover or door.  The Automatic device plugs into this, which may, as in our case, require that you completely remove the access door (since once the Automitic Link device is plugged in, the door won't close anymore).  Car servicers and emissions testers connect their diagnostics computer to this port to clear codes and to look at numerous aspects of the engines performance. For most cars, this includes RPM, transmission temperature, coolant temperature, fuel flow, oil pressure, and many other things that show up on your dash display like fuel level.  All of these parameters can be queried by a third-party device, such as Automatics device or a ScanGauge device (which is more customizable and can pull all of this information and can calculate mileage too).  Both the Automatic Link and ScanGuage products are powered by the OBD port.\n\nWhile ScanGauge pulls a lot of information from the on-board computer and allows you to customize the windows and displayed information, the Automatic Link displays only gas mileage.  Its not clear what other information the device may pull to do its mileage calculation, but it is clear that you cannot customize the interface on your iPhone to see anything else.  This makes sense when you consider that the Automatic device and its required iPhone (or Android) companion app are all built around helping you drive more efficiently.  However, this product is likely to appeal to tech-savvy folks, who will expect access to more information.  So here is a run-down of functionality, pros, and cons:\n\n- Setup was easy.  It automatically detected the vehicle type and VIN.  The con here, of course, its that if you are a privacy-aware, you might expect that this info is being sent to a server somewhere.  You MUST create on online login to use the app.\n\n- The iPhone app links up via Bluetooth.  You can leave the Link device plugged in all the time, so that when you get to your car, it links right back up.\n\n- Battery drain on the iPhone was acceptable.  There is no real-time information displayed while driving, so you can turn your iPhone display off while driving to save battery.\n\n- Each trip, no matter how short or long, is broken into segments, each of which is easy to navigate to on the home screen.  Information saved and displayed for each segment includes miles driven, mpg, fuel cost, time travelled, travel map, and your driving score.  The problem I had was that the mileage calculated was never anywhere close to reality.  I verified this on a long trip where I used the device from fuel stop to fuel stop.  I refilled and calculated refill gallons against odometer miles.  I got 14 mpg by my calcs, and Automatic calculated 7 or 8 mpg each time.  This is a huge difference and presents a major problem for a device that is all about calculating your mileage and helping you with fuel efficiency.  I checked my vehicles compatibility online, and Automatic confirmed that it would detect fill-ups and be able to calculate my mileage within 10%.  Based on what other reviewers are saying, it sounds like this device can be accurate...  Perhaps accuracy varies by vehicle manufacturer and model.\n\n- The unit calculates your driving score (0 to 100), and I was always getting 100.  Im sure Im not that perfect, some fine tuning on this algorithm would be good.  Note that the app does NOT show your driving score or mpg as you drive.\n\n- The Link device makes an audible sound when you go over 70 mpg, brake hard, or accelerate too fast.  This alert behavior was a little erratic when I tested it out.\n\nSUMMARY\nGood idea, but with mileage being as far off as it is, some refinement is needed.  Im pretty sure I won't save $100 gas by just using this device, so I think the developers need to broaden the appeal by allowing users to access more information.  Perhaps they could allow users to set up other screens (access with a swipe) to see other information such as tranny temp, coolant temp, rpms, and other tings that the on-board computer provides.  This is a fun gadget with a lot of potential; just needs some refinement and better mpg calculation.", "summary": "Nice start; needs some improvements to be truly useful; mpg was way off, which is a problem", "unixReviewTime": 1385856000}

I replace the coil with a set that I found on E Bay which was new and cheap and my cars runs great again. Just think what a mechanic would charge you for repairing this type of problem, this thing paid for itself on the second time i used it.

Deep", "reviewText": "I've been using Wheel Wax on various sets of wheels on my cars for about three years now on both painted and clearcoated polished aluminum. Before that, I used to use conventional car polish. This product is superior for several reasons. First it definitely lasts longer; I generally only apply it once a year though I suppose twice a year or more might be needed for a car driven more miles. Even toward the end of the year, I find that water still beads on the wheel pretty well, unlike it would on an untreated wheel. Supposedly this product is more heat resistant than a conventional car wax, thus lasting longer on the hot surface of a wheel.\n\nI agree with other comments that this product does not actually repel brake dust in the sense that you'll still see a dusting of it accumulating on the wheel as you drive. However it makes it much easier to wash the brake residue off the wheel assuming you do this somewhat regularly. I wouldn't expect any product to eliminate the need for washing your wheels.\n\nAs an added bonus Wheel Wax has a rich texture and applies smoothly, then is easy to remove with minimal buffing. Also it has a nice scent.", "summary": "May not repel brake dust, but makes wheel cleaning easier", "unixReviewTime": 1281052800}

Honestly couldn't care less what brand is on them, so long as they're as described. Unfortunately, they're absolutely not as described.\n\nThe clamps have stout springs and a nice finish to them, better fit than I've seen in a lot of other cables, honestly. The jaws close square and don't have a ton of slop in them. The cable itself is only tied to one side of the clamp, leaving a relatively small rivet and minimal surface contact between the clamp \"halves\" to carry the balance of current. Even then closing spring is isolated from the two halves and not resting on the handle itself, a trick often used in cheaper clamps in place of a dedicated conductor.\n\nWorse still; the cables are *not* 4AWG. In fact, they're nothing. They're marked in no way, anywhere along their length. I've never had a job that would allow using unmarked mystery cable, and I'm not really inclined to do so myself. Out of curiosity, I cut the cables open, and just like another reviewer, I found them to be notably undersized for \"4 gauge.\" They measure out to just between 5 and 6 gauge, which would explain why they're unmarked.\n\nYou get what you pay for, and these \"Made in China\" cables are no exception.\n\nI bought these knowing full-well I would never use them to attempt to start a vehicle, and bought \"oversized\" cables to be safe for my application. Seeing what they are, they're being relegated to the junk shelf for potential future projects with lower demand. I personally wouldn't trust these to start anything larger than a 1.8L gas engine in warm weather, assuming the battery is in good shape and clean terminals, and I'd consider that a gamble.\n\nIf you're just looking for peace of mind by having a cheap set of cables in the back of your car, go ahead and buy these.

A pickle fork works well to pull the bolt out once it's free of the nut.\n\nIn the back bolt - use a 13/16 wrench (do NOT attempt to use vice grips - you WILL round the nut) on the opposite side.  For me, on the passenger side, the hitch was in the way of pulling the bolt out - so I got it out far enough to cut it off with a angle grinder and then pulled it out by the nut on the other side.

The towing that I do with the Expedition is fairly close to home (usually within 125 miles radius of home) and usually relatively flat. On occasion I do it some significant hills when taking the RV out to western MA. These combined had me concerned with loads and temps on the tranny.\n\nI puchased (from Anmazon) a engine codes monitor that bluetooth's onto a smartphone or tablet, and started monitoring the tranny temp (via that set up). This was much easier than installing a trans temp gauge. The somewhat flat ride pulling the trailer down the interstate, on an 83 degree day had the tranny temp at 193 - 197 range.\n\nThis week I repeated the same exact trip (same camp ground) with an 85 degree day. The tranny temps climbed and stopped at a max of 161 degrees, with a range of 157 - 161. This offers great piece of mind running the tranny temps 30+ degrees cooler.\n\nAs noted, at 1st I was skeptical, as when I first installed the cooler, I noticed no diff in non-trailer towing temps (which generally ran between 147 and 155 depending on rpm and duration at that rpm).  So when not pulling the trailer, I was seeing no diff in temps before or after the cooler install. So I concluded it was not going to make much of a diff.  But in pulling the trailer, there is a large diff in temps. What I think is happening here is that the Tru-Cool unit has a calibrated flow section that only allows full flow of fluid once the tranny fluid thins out at higher temps. Without pulling the trailer, the fluid never really gets hot enough (the stock cooler or this supplemental cooler) and thins out enough to flow through all the vanes of the Tru Cool cooler (as that cooling capacity is not needed at those temps). But as the fluid got hotter and thinner, it does flow through those vanes that have a calibrated flow rate to them. Once the fluid is flowing through those vanes, at least for me,  the temps stopped increasing due to the extra cooling capacity. This is the design of this unit, and you know what... it really works.\n\nInstallation Notes:\n*  The cooler is a universal fit (as most coolers are) so you may need to get creative where and how you mount it and plumb the hoses.. Expect (as I imagine you already do) to be a little creative making some kind of mounting brackets and hose connectors. Ditto the mounting instructions are equally generic. You are assumed to have some basic mechanical ability\n*  The instructions are a bit misleading in that i says can be mounted in any orientation. That is true, it will work in any orientation, but it will be vastly more effective with the input / output barbs facing in the up orientation (this allows air to purge form the system, otherwise the top section of the cooler can become air-locked and effectively reduce / eliminate that cooling surface / capacity).  I spoke with Dana (makers of Tru-Cool) during the installation and they both confirmed this point and highly recommend the barbs up mounting.

Be careful not to OVER-OIL the pleats !!\n\n There are 2 types of Filtercharger Kits -- a \"Squeeze Bottle\" and an \"Aerosol Can\". After using both types, I find that it's MUCH easier to do a perfect job AND keep things neat if I avoid the Aerosol Can and go with the easier-to-control Squeeze Bottle. It's IMPORTANT that we don't apply TOO MUCH of the sticky \"oil\" to the filter pleats.\n\n NOTE:  Modern Fuel-Injected engines have \"MAF Sensors\" that are VERY sensitive to air-borne contaminants, and if too much oil is applied at filter-servicing, the results will be a contaminated MAF sensor -- and the resulting lack of performance and fuel economy.\n When servicing the K&N, you can avoid the contamination problem by removing the MAF sensor and cleaning it thoroughly with \"CRC Mass Air Flow Sensor Cleaner\" -- available at Amazon -- Follow the directions on the can EXACTLY, and your engine will run smoother and you'll save gas, too !!\n\nIf you are not prepared to properly care for your K&N Air Filter, DON'T buy one !!! Use the factory equipment Motorcraft and change every 12,000 miles.\n Good Luck !!", "summary": "Lets Your Engine BREATHE !!", "unixReviewTime": 1343088000}

I cut a small hole in the uppermost part of the backside and slid the wire in spanning the whole backkside of the bag. I took it to a shoe repair and had them stitch up the hole and arounbd thge wires so they didn't move. I was able to form it to the contour of the windshield and it's holding it's shape. The little side pouches are kind of a waste.
