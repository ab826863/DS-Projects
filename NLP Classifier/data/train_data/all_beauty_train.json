The trimmer does a decent job evening out the sideburns.  The razor tells you how much time the battery has left so you should never run out of juice in the middle of shave and it is easy to charge either on the stand or in the carring case the razor comes with.  The razor is really easy to clean.  And there is little to no irritation after the shave aside from a couple minutes of numbness right after the shave, but it's nothing a splash of water won't cure.\n\nBut if you want a close shave, a conventional razor is better but when I don't have time to break out the shaving cream, this razor will definately be suffciant.", "summary": "After Three Weeks of Use", "unixReviewTime": 1197590400}

I am an Aqua Velva Man and absolutely love this stuff, been using it for over 50 years. This is a true after shave lotion classic. Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.\n\nThere slogan was \" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN \" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.\n\nThe only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.\n\nAt any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.\n\nNote :::; Some reviewers mention this 7oz size now comes in a plastic container, I just bought one in Wal-Mart and it was glass.", "summary": "Truth is There IS Nothing Like an AQUA VELVA MAN.", "unixReviewTime": 1304380800}

Today's razors are so much better than years ago.\n\nEven though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.\n\nThe first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.\n\nAs for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.\n\nSo 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor.

If you want to look ten years younger, this is the cream to try. I find it helps with elasticity and skin resilience. I also notice I break out less and have overall clearer skin.

I first found it online by doing a search for things with pumpkin in it, and now I'm on my 4th bottle of this and I also recommend the body lotion and face creams, I am slowly becoming totally enamored with this brand and always look forward to trying more things.\n\nThis wash beats soap anytime in the shower; the orange gelee collapses on itself when poured and feels cool and refreshing especially in the morning. I love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. There is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing Dead Sea water and even spirulina extract, which I have drank before but never used in products. It feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. The bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.\n\nAs I get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. Parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately I keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy.

By reading lots of reviews, I notice that many people do not like potent scents, and prefer light, delicate or unobtrusive fragrances.  I am not one of them.  I don't particularly like heavy, sweet and cloying scents, but I do love to breathe in intense, true fragrances.  (I say all this not to disrespect those who like unscented or light scents, but to let you know where my rating is coming from.)\n\nI wanted to take a deep breath with my nose right up on this large bar of sandalwood and be able to say, \"Ahhh, sandalwood!\"  No, that did not happen.  Yes, the sandalwood fragrance is there, but there are other scents as well, and together, it all gentles down the sandalwood.  It is a lovely soap, but not the sandalwood fragrance I was hoping for.\n\nI have a bar of Plantlife Sandalwood soap that I bought about six weeks ago,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sandalwood-100-Pure-Natural-Aromatherapy-Herbal-Soap-4-oz-113g/dp/B00112DRHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sandalwood 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g)</a>.  It has way more sandalwood fragrance than this Pre de Provence.  But, interestingly, I noticed something when I traded that bar for the Pre de Provence:  While the Plantlife has the fragrance, Pre de Provence has the moisturizers.  When using the Pre de Provence, I definitely noticed that my legs, feet, arms, hands were not dry.  As soon as I went back to the Plantlife--just one day--that soap dried out my skin.\n\nSo, depends on what you are looking for in your soap.  If you want the intense fragrance, choose Plantlife, and give up soft and smooth skin.  I found both to give great lather, but only the Pre de Provence gave moisture.\n\nA word about the size of this 250g bar:  If you have long fingers or large hands, you will be able to grasp this bar easily.  If you have small hands, you might be better off with the 200g bar,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pre-de-Provence-Shea-Butter-Enriched-Artisanal-French-Soap-Bar-200-g-Traditional-Fragrance-Sandalwood/dp/B001UFZOMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pre de Provence Shea Butter Enriched Artisanal French Soap Bar (200 g), Traditional Fragrance - Sandalwood</a>, or the soap on a rope,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pre-de-Provence-Soap-On-a-Rope-Sandalwood-200-Gram/dp/B074QWY7CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pre de Provence Soap On a Rope, Sandalwood, 200 Gram</a>.

I put my regular application of hand cream on, and worked it in, and then, prepping for sleep, I put a big glob on my hands and rubbed it all around, sort of like you do on the face with a mask or hair with deep conditioner.  But the gloves are snug; some of the cream actually was pushed down to my wrist by the action of struggling into the gloves, and the rest of it soaked into the glove fabric once I had the gloves on.

This one is a lovely slightly violet polish in the red range. It's perfect for people like me who wear a lot of cool colors and have blue based coloring. The color in the bottle looks exactly like one in the photo on my screen, and slightly more red when it dried on my nails. I like it a lot. This color glides on very easily and almost covers in one coat. I did have to use a second coat to completely cover all the little spots that I missed the first time around. The polish looks good on its own, but the gel topcoat really sets it off. It gives my nails a hard, very shiny finish and helps to protect the manicure. It also smoothes out any imperfections that may have occurred when applying the first two coats. Don't skip it! The topcoat can also be worn on its own over bare nails for a nice shiny, finished look. But with so many beautiful Essie colors, why would you want to?\n\nThis polish was still going strong with only a hint of wear on the tip of one nail after 7 days. The top coat was still extremely shiny. My nails show growth at the base of the nail, so I usually change polish after 7 days. But if not for that, I probably could have gotten another couple days out of this polish. Great product!", "summary": "Lovely shade for winter or summer - VIPlease", "unixReviewTime": 1501286400}

I had hoped that I would be able to bury my nose in this bar from Pre de Provence and imagine that I had just opened a bottle of patchouli essential oil.  No, no, it did not happen.  While it is a lovely fragrance, it is somewhat meek and mild.  Maybe that is what you are looking for, but I wanted deep, true, powerful patchouli.\n\nWith this bar from Pre de Provence I do get rich, smoothing and soothing moisturizing.  It was opportune that I had recently purchased two bars of soap from Plantlife, patchouli and sandalwood.  Oh, my!  Those fragrances are potent and wonderful!  Way more so than those from Pre de Provence.  Having the two patchouli bars at the same time allowed me to see the moisturizing qualities of both soaps.  The Plantlife dried my skin.  This Pre de Provence always left my skin soft and supple.  It was a BIG difference; so easy to see when I had the two together.\n\nSo, when it comes to the patchouli and the sandalwood soaps, which one you would like better depends on what you are looking for in a soap:  True potent fragrance or moisturizing luxury.  For me it boils down to my skin's needs in the cooler, drier months, and that means I go with the Pre de Provence.\n\nIf you do want to try the Plantlife patchouli, this is it:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Patchouli-100-Pure-amp-Natural-Aromatherapy-Herbal-Soap-4-oz-113g/dp/B000146LKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Patchouli 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g)</a>.

That scared the hell out of me.\n\nI went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.\n\nI had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.\n\nI started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.\n\nMy dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)\n\nRegarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.\n\nSo when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)\n\nHmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)\n\nThe dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy.

Complete with toothpaste, floss and mouthwash, this would be a great gift.\n\nThe toothbrush has 5 settings, and it lists them in the description.  I prefer the sensitive setting, as I recently had gum surgery and am now very aware of how hard I am brushing, which leads me into that nice feature.  This toothbrush will slow and the red light will come on if you are brushing too hard.  I like that, because it reminds me to use lighter pressure.  It comes with a separate display that keeps track of how long you are brushing, and also has a clock.  The brush pauses when it is time to switch sides.  I like the carrying case, as you can place the unit and the separate brushes in it.\n\nI think it is a bit much with the display, personally.  The separate display portion is kind of a hassle.  I also wish it had a setting memory.  Every time you restart the toothbrush, it starts over at the first setting, so I have to press the arrow down to get to the sensitive setting.  It takes about 7 seconds, so you have wasted that time with the brush out of your mouth, trying to find the correct setting you like.\n\nI like it, it works well, there are just a few things I would prefer be different.  I prefer a little more of a simplistic toothbrush.", "summary": "Nice toothbrush with several great features", "unixReviewTime": 1385251200}

Poza", "reviewText": "Note: At the time of this review, seven different products are being sold on the same page. I am reviewing the lavendar lavender blossoms.\n\nThis is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.\n\nWhen you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.\n\nIf there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it.", "summary": "good natural scent", "unixReviewTime": 1505520000}

That doesn't bother me, but it might limit shareablity with my wife.

It is a subtle mint flavor, yet still leaves your mouth feeling fresh. \"Smooth\" fits the flavor/strength perfectly. It is not harsh at all, but still effective.\n\nThis mouthwash claims to help with inflammation and soreness of the gums. I'd say this claim is true. I wear braces and do get inflamed/sore gums from time to time. Crest Pro-Health For Life has helped with that. It actually soothes the gums. The inflammation goes away much quicker.\n\nI used this in my WaterPik with great results as well. Normally, I fill it up half way with warm water and the rest of the way with Listerine. My orthodontist recommended this on account of the gaps I get from my braces, to clean good and disinfect the loose gum area and to help the irritation/inflammation. I feel like this Pro-Health does a better job in that area - it feels like it is soothing the sore spots and like I said, the inflammation, soreness and redness goes away much faster.\n\nI did ask my orthodontist about using this mouthwash, if it would be beneficial to me in regards to the gum issues, since this product is meant for people over 50 years of age - I am only 36. He said it definitely could not hurt to try and would probably work well since it is made for gum issues. He told me to let him know how it goes. When I told him I believed it worked better and helped more, he told me to continue to use it. When he looked in my mouth in order to determine the adjustments for my braces during that visit, he mentioned to me that 2 particular areas look better than usual. The gum line at two specific teeth was always more red than any other area, even though it was never actually painful or swollen. Since I started using the Pro-Health, that redness has gone away.\n\nTo me, this product is very beneficial, while being gentle. There is no harsh alchohol taste, no nasty after taste. It is just simply a smooth mint flavor, just like the bottle says, that makes your mouth taste and feel fresh. In my case, it definitely did help with gum problems and for that reason I will continue to use it regularly.", "summary": "Smooth!", "unixReviewTime": 1368576000}

Therefore, I think it is better used as a body bar than a facial cleanser.\n\nMy experience with Dove products has been positive. They are good quality and reasonably priced. I think most men would be receptive to skin care but I think that subtle fragrance is more appealing than aggressive perfumes.", "summary": "Strongly Scented Soap", "unixReviewTime": 1364428800}

I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!\n\nTo get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.\n\nI agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).\n\nThe water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.\n\nSound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.\n\nThe auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.\n\nIn actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.\n\nGood performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.", "summary": "Clean teeth and fresh breath!", "unixReviewTime": 1176595200}

The whip is a semi solid, sort of like coconut oil texture when it gets cool. The scent is very light and doesn't really smell of anything, no floral or perfume smell. The directions say to use a walnut size scoop, but since my hair is short I used about half that. Towel dry, scoop, put on hair, run through, dry. Easy enough, the whip didn't feel heavy on my fingers or hair, it rubbed through easily and I got out my blow dryer and went to work.\n\nThe crown and top of my hair plumped right up, and styled easily. I blew it flat by the ears so it wouldn't stick out and that worked too, so if you're doing a convoluted have lift half flat style this will work just fine. There is no residue feeling when I run my hand through my hair, and the volume probably increased by a good half.\n\nI'm very pleased with the Tono&Guy (Liked the shampoo too, but that's another review) and my plump hair, now if my tummy would just get the memo I'd be set.", "summary": "Volume", "unixReviewTime": 1393632000}

When the bag arrived and we smelled it, we had the brilliant idea to put it in our scent warmer (ceramic warmer that is warmed by an electronic light). It worked out so well! Our house smells like lavender and it is amazing.\n\nThese dried lavender blossoms are very potent too. We only used about half a handful. So, we still have almost the entire bag to use for later. It will last for a long time. These would also be great for making clothing bags. If you place a little bit in a cheesecloth type bag and place it in your drawers, it makes your drawer and the items inside smell incredible.

But the star of the kit, the best thing about it for sure, is the enclosed clock and brushing \"meter\".  What it does is keeps track of how long you brush, giving you four stars for 30 seconds on each mouth quadrant.  You can also get a fifth star (for tongue) if you go a total of 2 1/2 minutes.  For me, that's not a big deal.  But for my six year old, the stars have been a boon to getting him to brush more thoroughly.\n\nHe brushes with enthusiasm now, and I've noticed his teeth looking much cleaner than with just a brush alone.  For me, it's a helpful reminder to brush longer than I was used to.  The whole set is convenient, with a countertop charger and no batteries being required.  And having a clock in the bathroom was new to me, and very convenient.\n\nHowever, two things keep me from giving it five stars.  One, the price point.  I wouldn't pay more than $50 for this set.  In all actuality, it doesn't seem worth the extremely high price point.  I mean, a Crest tote bag?  What am I going to do with that?  I don't think the set warrants the price.\n\nThe other minor point about this is you have to brush with your mouth tightly closed or you get watery toothpaste sprayed all over the mirror and counter.  Not to mention your face!  My son has to brush before he dresses or his school shirts get ruined.  So, it's a minor thing to get used to, but sort of annoying.\n\nIn all, a great set that would be better if it were more affordable.", "summary": "Excellent set but a steep price!", "unixReviewTime": 1386633600}

This enables him to get a smooth feeling on the skin without stripping and irritating it, and no creams and products are needed. The 3 rotating heads really adjust to the contour of the face and they snap open for easy clean up with water. I've seen him use it and it's a cinch, fast, easy and no mess!\n\nOverall this is a great product, it works well and the face feels and looks good afterwards and it takes very little time to use. Better than shaving when it comes to comfort but my man still prefers the razor when he has to shave for work.

To have such wonderful French products available here at the touch of my computer screen is a real treat!\nThis line of soaps with Shea butter is especially comforting and gratifying.

Just lovely!\n\nThe shea butter in this bar seems to make the lather glide smoothly across my skin.  It washes off well, yet seems to leave a softness behind that clings to my skin.  The little brownish pieces in the bar are actually pieces of petal.  I does not add any coarseness to the bar, and I think it may be included just to add to the \"artisanal\" look.

I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.\n\nI poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent.

It is a subtle mint flavor, yet still leaves your mouth feeling fresh. \"Smooth\" fits the flavor/strength perfectly. It is not harsh at all, but still effective.\n\nThis mouthwash claims to help with inflammation and soreness of the gums. I'd say this claim is true. I wear braces and do get inflamed/sore gums from time to time. Crest Pro-Health For Life has helped with that. It actually soothes the gums. The inflammation goes away much quicker.\n\nI used this in my WaterPik with great results as well. Normally, I fill it up half way with warm water and the rest of the way with Listerine. My orthodontist recommended this on account of the gaps I get from my braces, to clean good and disinfect the loose gum area and to help the irritation/inflammation. I feel like this Pro-Health does a better job in that area - it feels like it is soothing the sore spots and like I said, the inflammation, soreness and redness goes away much faster.\n\nI did ask my orthodontist about using this mouthwash, if it would be beneficial to me in regards to the gum issues, since this product is meant for people over 50 years of age - I am only 36. He said it definitely could not hurt to try and would probably work well since it is made for gum issues. He told  me to let him know how it goes. When I told him I believed it worked better and helped more, he told me to continue to use it. When he looked in my mouth in order to determine the adjustments for my braces during that visit, he mentioned to me that 2 particular areas look better than usual. The gum line at two specific teeth was always more red than any other area, even though it was never actually painful or swollen. Since I started using the Pro-Health, that redness has gone away.\n\nTo me, this product is very beneficial, while being gentle. There is no harsh alchohol taste, no nasty after taste. It is just simply a smooth mint flavor, just like the bottle says, that makes your mouth taste and feel fresh. In my case, it definitely did help with gum problems and for that reason I will continue to use it regularly.", "summary": "Smooth!", "unixReviewTime": 1368576000}

The combination of these two is, without a doubt, the best offering essie has ever put out there.\n\nFirst of all, I hate it when you get a cream polish and it takes three or four coats in order to get it to look opaque. There was so much pigmentation in this nail polish that I could have gotten by with just one coat, although I put on two. The photograph shows the two coats on my hand.\nAfter doing one hand, the polish started to thicken up a little on my second hand. I've noticed that this often happens with quick dry formulas. No problem, I just wait a minute and then reshake the bottle.\nIf you don't do that, it can come out thick, which makes it a little streaky or textured. Even if that's the case, all of those imperfections disappear when you apply this magical top coat. No, I'm not exaggerating. It really is Magic.\nIt evens the color and gives you a perfect shine that lasts for days and days.\n\nAnd here is the part that I want to shout out... If all of the above weren't enough to make you really love this stuff, hold on because there's more.\nI have long complained that I don't like the Essie nail polish brushes. They're great if you have small and short nails, in my opinion, but not for me.\nThe brush has a perfect curve that matches the base of your nail, and it's wider so that with three strokes, middle side, and side, you are DONE. The brush holds just the right amount of polish.\nThis review is for the VIPlease color. I think of it as a hibiscus or raspberry shade.\nIt looks great when you're wearing blue, pink, and even certain shades of burgundy. It's absolutely stunning with tropical prints that include flowers and greenery.\nGetting the kit is a great way to try the top coat.\nIf your experience is as good as mine, this will be the only topcoat you ever use from now on.", "summary": "The.

Today's razors are so much better than years ago.\n\nEven though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.\n\nThe first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.\n\nAs for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.\n\nSo 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor.

This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.\n\nThere is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.\n\nThe tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.\n\nIt is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.\n\nThe bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it.

I've always enjoyed the scent of lavender, and with a busy household I had hoped to use this as a potpourri to improve various mystery smells that can occur in a home with two kids. Unfortunately, it didn't work the way I had hoped.  While the dried blossoms are amusing to play with, as dried herbs often are, they are not exactly pretty compared to flower petal potpourri. It's also sad that the bag is not designed to be resealed. If you're careful you may be able to use the original sticky seal, but you have to be very careful opening and closing the bag.

They are also supposed to provide the longevity of a gel manicure, without the need for a curing light or the difficult removal process.  The color I received, Beau-Tie, is a pretty deep purple creme.  It looks quite blue-leaning in the bottle, but is actually much warmer on the nail.  In any case, the color was pretty, and the polish did look nice on my nails.  The instructions say to use the polish on bare nails (no base coat), do two coats, and follow with a coat of topper.  I did this, and I did have a nice, shiny manicure.  The shine was obvious, but I'm not convinced that it's anything exclusive to Essie.  There are other topcoats that will give you a similar appearance.  This polish definitely did not last the two weeks that the package claimed it would.  I found it lasted for about as long as any other polish when worn with a good topcoat- about four days.  The bigger issue, for me, is that without a base coat, my nails were in rough shape when this polish started chipping and I removed it.  They've been weak, peeling, and splitting.  The result is that I won't be wearing this without base coat again.  The bigger takeaway is that I don't find this to be fundamentally different from other nail polishes.  The \"gel couture\" business seems like a gimmick.  Also, I'm accustomed to using a quick dry topcoat, and this one takes much longer.

The claims on the back about containing 1/4 moisturizing cream appear to be quite true. Compared to the sometimes tight, post shower feel that I get with my usual choice of soap (generally the plain Kirkland brand at Costco), this is clearly a superior bar of soap.\n\nThe only drawback to this soap is the scent, which is the usual strong smell for men's hair and body products. If it were a little less intense, it'd be okay, but it is so strong that the paper box the soap comes in reeks of it. If you're okay with the strong smell and you want something which leaves you very clean but still with soft skin, this is a pretty good choice which is several cuts above the cheap stuff.", "summary": "Perfect, except for the strong scent", "unixReviewTime": 1365120000}

Many years have past and I have shot through quite a few Waterpik models and this is the current one I own. It is a little more evolved than its predecessors, but it still performs in pretty much the same way it always has. You fill the reservoir with water, attach the head to the handle which has a control to turn the water stream on and off, and then turn the device on to produce a spray of water as you move the head around to remove debris from between your teeth and gums. I think of the Waterpik as a power washer for the teeth and gums because it forces out pressurized water to irrigate those areas.\nThis model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. It also comes with six different tips. While I use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.\nOther than eliminating the need to floss, the Waterpik has been beneficial to me. My teeth are always clean, I don't have gum disease, plaque, dental decay, etc.\nThe Waterpik is easy to use and maintain and has  paid for itself many times over since I never buy floss.", "summary": "For Those Who Want To Save What Nature Gave Them", "unixReviewTime": 1338249600}

There is a selection of four brush heads included, and I like the spinning head the best.  I have been using an Oral-B 1000 model for a few weeks so can compare it to this high-end 5000 model.\n\nThe charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts. At least when new, the battery will last for more than week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings. There are several brushing modes, including one for sensitive teeth and a mode with longer brushing times.  The sensitive mode is noticeably gentler.\n\nThis model will alert when a 30 or 45 second brushing time per quadrant has finished, by pulsing and with the little radio timer.  I don't really like the timer feature but it would be very helpful to teach a child how to brush; the visual reinforcement is effective.\n\nThe brush tips change easily but don't come off under use and they have colored rings to identify brush heads for multiple users. The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic so it is comfortable and easy to grip. It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems. I would hesitate to actually immerse the bottom of the handle, though.\n\nIt is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes; it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque. Be especially careful if you have gum recession or crowns.  Fortunately, this model warns about using too much pressure.  I find this helpful.\n\nThere is an accessory that fits over the charging base to hold extra toothbrush heads which some may find useful as well as a carrying case.  I probably wouldn't bother with the weight and bulk when traveling and will continue to carry a manual toothbrush.\n\nNo complaints at all with this toothbrush except that the handle shows water and toothpaste residue and the heads are rather costly compared to a manual toothbrush. I do think it's worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing, although the less-expensive models have the same basic features. An electric toothbrush would be especially helpful for anyone with arthritis in the hands.", "summary": "Complete kit with 5000 model toothbrush", "unixReviewTime": 1386115200}
