No problems.\n\nI bought from a different website, but I buy items from Amazon too, and thought I would share my experiences...ACTUALLY, I see that it is the SAME VENDOR!!!! Sigler Music. Same price, free shipping as here on Amazon.\n\nI bought mine after 2 Accurate Tool inverters went dead. The 1500watt PSW went dead in a little over one month. The 2000 only lasted about 18 days. Both bought on the \"auction\" website...E-you know what...so both were beyond the return date. Pffffft....\n  Well, I have had the Tiger Claw, or (FU JOW) in Chinese, for 3 weeks. I use two 100ah batteries, with 2/0 cable, with my 850watt power consumption microwave (600watt output),...and the cables only get just noticeably a TAD warm, by the 200 amp ANL fuse I have. I don't plan on running anything more than 1000 watts...if that. It is quite a drain on the batteries. If you have the capacity, this should run just about anything up to 1300 watts pretty well...assuming you have thick cables, and plenty of JUICE!!!!!!\n\nI have had no trouble with the unit at all. There is a new version out, where CFL bulbs don't flicker. My CFL bulbs do not flicker. So, next generation...There was also a Fan issue, when they power up, they would be weak and click. I connected a .01 micro farad ceramic disk capacitor to the negative terminal, and the case ground. (it does not matter which wire goes to the negative terminal)... The fans power up just fine. Youtube is great for information!!\n  When running the microwave the fans kick on after about 2 minutes, otherwise for a 300 watt 1 cup coffee maker, it is silent.\n  This is the best price for a 1500watt PSW inverter, even on the \"auction\" website. The Accurate Tools Inverters were cheap...but did not last...they were over voltaged at 125volts. The Tiger Claw reads 114.9, or so...which drops a bit to 111.9 or so when powering something.\n  My application is a Solar Generator, still working on getting the panels up and running, but I have the batteries in a roll-able box, with the inverter mounted on the front. The Microwave can sit on top. I can put it in my car, or roll around to where I need it in the house. And eventually will charge it with the Sun.\n  I have read where people have used them for 15 months or more, and so, it seemed reliable, and that is why I got one. The unit is solid, and seems well built, but there are no voltage/wattage meters, nor is there a USB port.  I hope my unit continues to do well.\n  So far, I like it allot.", "summary": "Seems to be good!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1404518400}

I tried to repeat the same procedure in each case.  Each says to use 1 oz of the car wash liquid to one gallon of water.  For each one I used a tablespoon to measure the car wash, placed it into my car wash bucket, then added the same amount of hot water from the faucet.  Each produced about the same amount of suds.  The results are in my last paragraph if you want to skip ahead.\n\nThe Griot's Garage container states: Brilliant Finish Car Wash is made from premium ingredients to ensure you maintain paint care perfection, bucket after bucket. Its thick, concentrated formula makes tons of suds, produces a streak-free finish, is pH balanced (which prevents wax stripping), safe on all exterior finishes, and is biodegradable.\n\nThe Meguiar's Gold Class container states: Meguiar's Gold Class Car Wash Shampoo and Conditioner is a rich and luxurious product designed to both wash and condition paint in one easy step. The premium formula gently foams away {when I recorded this with Dragon Naturally Speaking v13, it thought I said \"bombs away\"} tough dirt, road grime and contaminants without compromising wax protection. Ultrarich paint conditioners clear away debris to reveal color and clarity, leaving paint looking radiant. The Gold Class Collection blends the finest conditioners and premium ingredients to deliver exceptional results. The detergent is biodegradable.\n\nI washed one side of my car with the Griot's and the other side with Meguiar's.  The end result was that it was pretty much a toss up.  They are both good products.  The Meguiar's suds may have lasted a bit longer but that is just subjective.  I was quite satisfied with both products and I can't say that one performed really better than the other.  So it is just a matter of personal preference and possibly whether you plan to use other products by Griot's or Meguiar's.  You might also have a preference to the smell.  The Griot's has kind of a watermelon scent and the Meguiar's has a rich shampoo type scent that I prefer more.  Also, I can say that based upon Amazon's current prices, the 64 oz Griot's is $12.99 and the 64 oz Meguiar's is $8.49, so the Griot's cost is about 50 percent more.  Thinking of it in terms of making a gallon of car wash, the cost difference is negligible as the cost of the Griot's is $0.20 per gallon and the Meguiar's is $0.13 per gallon.  So take your pick.

Yes, it's cheaply made and has some silly design elements, but I paid about twenty bucks and it has paid for itself in emergency use.\n\nSilly design elements first: the flash light is merely OK, but a light would have been more useful had it illuminated the gauge. Plus, the illumination that the light provides is only good for close up work (but not detailed work). Second, the gauge is difficult to read, even in the light, with my sixty-five year old eyes. I have to 'guesstimate' 33 PSI, which my current vehicle requires.\n\nHowever, on the plus side I can reach all four tires on my 2014 Outlander as long as I switch doors for each side of the vehicle. And it may take a long time to inflate from, say, 28 to 33 PSI (over five minutes), it is a big help when I am nowhere near a real compressor. Therein lies the value - I can top off my tires anytime the 'Low Tire Pressure' light comes on. That happens about twice a year for me since we experience some sharp weather changes in my region about that frequently. To be honest, I try to maintain optimum pressure by checking my levels monthly and resolving any condition at a local gas station before it becomes a problem. But when the temperature drops from the 70s to the 30s like it sometimes does the pressure drops accordingly.\n\nSince 2008 I've probably used this thirty times. It costs a buck to use the gas station air pump, and I paid about twenty bucks for this at a big box store. Plus, it's still operational, so I have more than gotten my money's worth from it.\n\nThis is not the best quality pump and it has some flaws, but when you need one - you need one!

More often than not, we hoist 2 tandems up on to the roof and the Hullavators handle them with ease. Only one caveat, though - with tandems, it's not a one-person operation. Put a person on each arm when lifting or lowering. Third, a bit pricey; I wish Amazon & Thule could find a way to bring these in under $500 - I would buy another pair or two.\n\nUPDATE (2013): Price came down just under $500 so I bought another pair (now I can put two kayaks on the roof of my pickup as well as on my Escape). Initially wanted to buy the roof rack mounts pieces only so I could use the main assemblies of the two pair I already had. But Thule apparently is not making/selling these parts. And if they were still selling them the price was $70 plus for them. So I figured I would just buy the whole \"kit & caboodle.\"\n\nUPDATE (August 2014): Amazon is now selling these fantastic roof racks at a price point under $425! An incredible bargain!

Just to cut down on problems I usually do all my hid installs with a relay to prevent future issues such as light flickering and powering issues. Kit is great quality and lights are bright.

To my amazement the fishing wire that was included actually worked.  That is of course after I filed the round bolt heads into ovals in order to fit them through the frame opening.  And, after I got the first bolt routed through the frame I found out that the nuts included were the wrong size and would not work.  After a 20 minute excursion to my local hardware store (with the other bolt in hand), I was back at it filing down the second bolt head so it would fit through the frame opening.

Unfortunately the last one was stolen. I believe this one will be my favorite for the following reasons. Number one is the auto shut off. Many units require that you return to the pumps to shut it off. In the past I would over fill the tire, return to the pump, shut it off and then return to the tire and reduce air to the proper pressure. Doable but extra effort. Number two is the continuous run cycle. Many units can run for 15 minutes then require a 30 minute cool down time. While maybe not important to some why risk it and have the auto thermal protection shut it down and wait 30 minutes. As an added bonus I suspect to get the continues run time the rpms on the motor have been reduced and the unit is pretty quiet. Number three the supplied air gun has a bleed off button which allows you to reduce air pressure easily if you over fill. Number four the unit comes with two hoses, the extension for dully tires and the air gun with gage so you are ready for most anything. Number five the whole package is small enough to fit under most SUV's back seat. It is high quality and not cheap like some you see in some discount stores and gives you a \"get to the tire store\" back up as well as avoids you having to locate a gas station with an air pump, chunk in quarters and hope it works for a simple air top off. About the only downside I can see is because the gage goes to 170 if you routinely fill passenger 32 LBS tires you may want to  add a smaller scale gage for a bit more accuracy. My package also came with the screw on valve connection. Very solid but if you do a lot of tires the \"flip down\" one would be quicker. It is available separately.

I hoped the book would do a better job of helping me determine what transmission I have, but it doesn't.  Since my Jeep is a 3-speed built in '74, it helped me narrow down the possibilities.  HOWEVER, that is assuming the trans is original and hasn't been replaced with a newer year.\nAlso you will need a good understanding of working on cars to fully utilize this book.  Some of procedures list several steps and give the order to remove certain parts.  It's very good information, unless you are uncertain on what each part is.  For example, I thought the little \"widget\" part between the battery and the starter was bad.  I wanted to test/replace it but I didn't know what it was called.  After much searching I ended up finding it listed in the electrical section and the widget was a starter solenoid.

Then push on the tool until you feel the click.  Once you feel the click, you stop pushing tension on the belt with your finger and then look at the resulting measurement.  The top of the moving arm (left of the picture in this product description) intersects with the scale of numbers engraved on the tool.  Wherever that intersection point lies is the resulting belt tension number.  I can tell the tool basically converts some level of belt deflection into a corresponding tension number.  By applying the specified amount of tension (i.e. up to the point of the clicking noise of the tool), the belt has deflected a certain amount and the moving arm will only move up as much as the belt has deflected.  So I would say the key aspect to this tool is when the clicking happens which assures when the appropriate amount of deflection has been applied and then to read the measurement thereafter.  Very cool tool.\n\nThe only possible ways I can see a wrong measurement occuring is if the user applies more force to the belt (after the clicking already  happened) or if the clicking mechanism is out of calibration and clicks too early or too late (thereby applying too little or too much force to the belt to create a wrong measurement).  I can't imagine the clicking being out of calibration as it looks like a very simple mechanism.  So I would say this tool is very accurate almost all the time.  I took a few readings of my belt and always got fairly consistent readings, maybe differing by plus/minus 10 lbs.\n\nI read in some forums where people would say they had no room to insert this tool, but the tool is only 5 inches long (shorter than most pens) and for the most part, if you have room to put your finger on a belt and be able to push on it, you will most likely be able to fit this tool there too.  The tool has a rubber strap for your finger to help prevent you from dropping it while finding your way to the belt.  Since it's so small, I might recommend you have one of those telescopic magnetic pick-up tools handy in case you drop it down in the engine compartment somewhere since the tool is that small (however, the only magnetic part of the krikit I got is on the pen clip).\n\nYou should also be aware that the krikit model 91132 has a tension measurement range of 100-320 lbs while model 91107 has a lower range (30-160 lbs).  My car ('03 G35) requires a new belt tension of greater than 200 lbs on one of the belts, so I got the 91132.\n\nI also wanted to comment on the other amazon user reviewer who mentioned the gauge was ineffective for him.  I would have to say he likely has loose belts because the tool, in my opinion, is highly accurate if used correctly and it's kind of hard to use it incorrectly.  But even with loose belts, you might never notice any noticeable squeeling...basically you can be lucky and never see a problem until the next belt change.\n\nI tried to cover as much as I can because I could never find anyone giving a detailed review of this product which would have helped me evaluate this product prior to buying it, but now that I have it and actually used it, I think it's a very handy gauge and anyone who needs to manually adjust their belt tension should get one.  I know some people can tension their belts by feel or using some belt twisting rule of thumb, and that's how I used to do it too, but I get much peace of minding know that my belt is tensioned EXACTLY to specs.", "summary": "No need for more expensive gauges.", "unixReviewTime": 1262131200}

They also produce a beam pattern on the road instead of a smooth light pattern.  The bulbs are basically just resting inside the housing at this point being held in place by the cover that goes on the back of the unit to keep water out. The light brightness itself isn't much brighter than the Philips Crystal Vision bulbs I was replacing these with. The only possible benefit of these LEDs is lifespan.

When we pushed the quad back up on its wheels and assessed the damage.  The front fender was displaced enough to notice, and the Swivel Plate on the gun boot was bent.  The Boot itself was fine aside from some very minor scratches and the rifle inside was perfect.  We tried to pull the bracket out by hand and couldn't do it.  Its a pretty stiff piece of metal.

If it curves around, it can get caught on the bottom of the dipstick tube (not polished smooth) and just shear off, leaving hose in your oil pan.

The instructions convert this for you on a chart.\n\nWithout going into much detail, it worked very well.  You will need to have some significant arm strength for 1/4 SS rivets, but the tool powered through it.

The \"pins\" are pretty easy to insert and pull out once you get a feel for them. The rear guards install in about 5 mins. You simply ADD them to the molding and put in some pins and screws. The front guards take a little more time because you must REPLACE the factory moldings with the splash guard moldings. The hardest part of the install for me was removing the factory moldings. Make sure you OPEN the doors! Also, a couple of pins did not come out for me initially. I had to use a pair of needle nose pliers to remove them after I removed the factory moldings. But not a big deal at all. Once the factory moldings were off, it was easy to put in the splash guard moldings. I recommend spending about 5 mins studying the instructions (from the Subaru Tech website), and then going for the install.

On the rest of my leather, I prefer water based.\n\nAll preservatives/conditioners want you to use a microfiber cloth (or similar.) I'm a guy, and honestly I prefer to squirt the conditioner on my hand and use my palms and fingers to work in the conditioner.  I'm not saying it's the best idea, but I've done it for years. There's also no waste. Anyway, this in non-greasy, with no residue. If you happen to apply too much, a dry cloth will take it right off.  Depending on the leather, this can dry flat or glossy. You can it on an unobtrusive part of your clothing or footwear to see.  It's a preservative and conditioner, not a polish.\n\nOn tight-grain leather, like car seats and purser, it will be glossy.  I found that for a pair of man's western boots, it took about two tablespoons of Wild Bill's conditioner per boot. Sometimes my boots will sit in the closet for months - especially the winter wear. I make it a point to treat my boots quarterly, weather or not I've worn them.

Three were just new holes for the screws to pass through but one had to be ground out and enlarged to allow an over size plastic \"dimple\" (for lack of a better word) to fit in.  Of course my meager shop doesn't have the grinder necessary and a trip to town to the hardware store was in order (50 miles round trip).  Then there is this plastic door mount screw that needs to be replaced... So far, one side is done and Im tempted to take it all apart, put it back in the box and send the whole darn thing back.", "summary": "If you have Ride Command, don't buy this product.", "unixReviewTime": 1524268800}

Low end torque is immediately improved an noticible, no increase in noise or other changes. For those that know BMW's, the 2010 335xi used the N54 twin turbo engine. I owned this vehicle and used KN air filters, it was quite a car. Then I traded it for a 2011 335xi, which uses the N55 \"twin power\" turbo - note the difference, this engine has only one turbo whereas the N54 has two turbos. There is a definite decrease in torque with the N55, and I was unhappy to say the least. My 2011 BMW had the sport package and nav, though, which is why I upgraded - the seats alone are worth the upgrade. Anyway, after installing this new KN air filter, my 2011 335xi runs with what appears to be at least the same, if not more, power than my former twin-turbo BMW.

I learned about the product at the Rolls-Royce dealer. You really need a better endorsement than that? If you're not convinced let me explain some extremely basic science behind this For generations people waxed their car using some form of carnauba wax. The reality is the wax does not adhere to the paint and is gone in about three weeks. Now this assumes a few things which includes daily driving, getting your car washed, rain, etc. This product is an amazingly durable polymer which sticks to your paint and really doesn't come off for at least a year. It has a very different type of shine than wax but I believe most enthusiasts will like it just the same.\n\nSo what's the downside? This stuff is a real pain to apply and take off. It goes on like butter because it's a liquid but taking it off requires a professional polisher. If you leave it on too long you're going to have a problem. I get my car detailed once a year at the dealership and bring them this instead of the glaze that they normally use. Notice I said glaze and not wax, nobody's using wax anymore it's simply not as effective. To use another analogy 100 years ago people were using a horse-drawn buggy to get from place to place today we have cars. For 50 years or so people used wax to protect their cars paint, today science has given us polymer. Here's the bottom line, the dealership who charges nearly $400,000 for a car uses this product. That convinced me to try for myself and I've been using it faithfully on my cars for the last five years or so. I get more compliments about the appearance of my car now than I ever did using even the fanciest waxes.\n\nOne final suggestion, if you're going to attempt to do this yourself you want to start by thoroughly washing your car and making sure that you use a soap that takes off any wax that may still be on the car. Next you have to use a clay bar and lubricant, without this step putting the polymer on it is pointless. As a matter of fact it will damage your paint because you will be ceiling in road grime. Once the car is properly prepped it's time to use very small sections until the car is done. You only need one coat and you will be amazed at the results for at least a year. My strong recommendation is taken to an auto detail company or dealership that you trust and tell them to use this (tell them to follow the instructions on the bottle) instead of whatever they use. You will not regret it. Good luck", "summary": "Simply the best polymer money can buy simply the best you can buy for your car", "unixReviewTime": 1469664000}

Green", "reviewText": "This specific mirror was an OEM option in the 2003-2006 Jeep Wrangler, and my 2006 Wrangler had it from the factory. The lights were a great enhancement to the dome lights behind me, because my head would often block the light from the dome lights behind me (duh!) while these lights were lighting it up from the front. The compass and temperature are always right there visible and are very handy in an offroad vehicle (as you'd imagine).  When I upgraded to a 2012 Wrangler I was shocked to find no auto-dim mirror option available from Chiseler Corporation (intentional mis-spelling of the car company name to describe their habitual behavior). I tried to get along with the stock flip-up mirror but after so many years of the auto-dim mirror it was like going back to horse and buggy days. A Google search uncovered this specific mirror, which is absolutely 100% identical to the mirror that came factory in my old Jeep. Yay!\n\nOnly downside: Wiring it up into a vehicle not already wired for it can be tedious. In my case I have a good spot for the temperature sensor and an easy wiring path to get a wire there and a known good source of auxiliary power, and know how to trace wires to e.g. the sport bar dome light back to a point where I can splice into it for these dome lights, but if you're not good with electrical stuff then you'll want to pay an auto electrical shop to do the wiring for you.  So if you have an older 2001-2006 Wrangler without this mirror it's pretty easy to wire up this mirror (the wiring to use it already exists under the plastic panel at the side of the windshield, the temperature sensor wire is even already run to behind the front radiator grill ready for you to plug in the temperature sensor), otherwise be forewarned -- it's not the world's hardest wiring job, but it's non-trivial.", "summary": "OEM quality, aftermarket price", "unixReviewTime": 1320364800}

There is a fan that makes noise when you turn it on.  This is a good indicator to let you know that your unit is on and its working.  Also, this was meant to be used when your car is on. So when you're driving, you wouldn't even notice the noise especially if you have the music on (not sure why people complained about that).  Anyway, I was able to use this to charge a 13\" Macbook (which only required 65W) and simultaneously charge a USB device as well.  There are multiple USB charging slots available but just know that the USB chargers all draw from the same power so if you plug in two or three devices the charging will be split between them which means they won't charge as fast.

I am very familiar with installation and it typically takes me all of 5 minutes to install and this was set up like any other Bi-Xenon kit, however my first issue was the bulbs had to be forced into the light housing as they are pretty oversized.  Probable cause being the fact they are Bi-Xenon and that requires a mechanism to move the bulb forward and back for Hi-Low beams.  However, that makes it difficult to install the bulbs in the case of the 9007 because of the tube it has to be jammed into is now too small for the bulb.  However that was over come after 10 or 15 minutes of trying to force it in.  The next problem arrived when I went to test the kit.  I switched on my Rangers headlights.  The familiar whine/hum of the ballasts kicked in and the familiar strengthening glow filled my garage.  After allowing the bulbs to reach full strength (which notably did not take long) I flicked the bulbs up to High beam... and nothing happened.  I tried twice more despite Einstein's definition of insanity.  This was not the first time I have had this problem with a new set of Bi-Xenon. The problem stems from the relay being incorrectly wired where it plugs into the cars light socket.  Because I already understood the problem I chose not to call customer service so I can not attest to customer service only to their product quality control.  After a few minutes I was able to determine the correct order of the wires and I now have the kit functioning.  I am underwhelmed with what the high-beams look like.  I will probably be replacing the bulbs with some from another company at some point in the future.  Still not a bad deal for the money and just the low-beam is much better than the stock lights.  Not sure if I would buy another kit from Innovited although the kit I put in my wife's car is nice (also Bi-Xenon just a different size).

One of which is the fact of course that it comes in manual mode where you have to shut the car down in a certain way in order to be able to remote start it. The only downfall is that once you actually open, not unlock, the doors, the sequence is broken and you have to jump in and reset the sequence. Engine on, car in gear, car in neutral, with foot on brake set the e-brake, on the remote hit the lock button, remove key exit car, hit the lock button. It's quite annoying but I've managed to find sort of a workaround. If you need to get back in your car, just remote start it, then unlock it go in do what you need to do, then close the doors and s*** off the remote start. sequence is still in tact and you get to open the doors.\n\n As everyone say that one mile range is like in a perfectly clear line of site. Sometimes I can't hit my car from less that a tenth of a mile away because there is a row of houses in between. Another weird thing that happens is that sometimes I'll try to start , it will say out of range, then I'll try again and it will say \"deactivated\" meaning the first time actually worked. In addition, I'll  be able to hit the unlock and lock buttons, but not moving from the same spot, have the remote start say out of range.\n\nAs for the buttons, they do press incredibly easily and you can very well lock/unlock/start your car without knowing. My solution was to use the auto button lock that they provide as a feature, but that also leads to some slight issues where you can remote start your car by accident if the buttons are already unlocked. The combination of buttons to unlock the buttons are the remote start, then unlock. That unlocks the buttons, but if your buttons are already unlocked, you just started and unlocked your car. My solution to this was to always roll the jog wheel first to check. If the keys are unlocked it will go into the features menu, if not it will let you know immediately that the keys are locked.\n\nI also purchased this case&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Black-Leather-Case-for-Viper-7944V-Remote-Systems/dp/B00IKOY842/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Black Leather Case for Viper 7944V Remote Systems</a>&nbsp;since there is no real screen protector for this and I'd rather not have to buy another remote for an accidental drop or scratched screen from my keys. The case definitely adds some bulk though.\n\nThe LED screen is beautiful, it kills the battery a little but the remote is usb rechargeable so that's not a problem. Also, the tones were annoying to me so I turned off the action tones and only have the buttons tones on. Then I realized that I would never know if someone was actually breaking into my car so I turned on the vibration.\n\nI haven't added any other sensors to it as yet since I was on a budget and really just wanted a starter but I'm looking forward to trying some of the other sensors.\n\nI'm sure there are features that I left out, but I hope this helps", "summary": "Definitely a great buy.", "unixReviewTime": 1455667200}

I was surprised when I realized how loose it still was, once I got it torqued to spec it was solid. I stood on the hitch and bounced to check it out. I luckily didn't have any issues with the rack being bent during shipping like others have said.\n\nOnce more note, I bought this for a 2013 Rav4. While it fits perfectly, anything you're towing is going to have little ground clearance. Its not the hitch's fault, the Rav4 just doesnt have a lot of clearance. Our bike rack has hit the ground on steep driveways, not the outer part of the rack but the part thats sticking out from the hitch. I measured the ground clearance for our rack at the hitch point and it was only 8 inches. Granted, the car was loaded with camping gear, the bikes/rack weight but even unloaded we only had 9.5 inches.", "summary": "A sturdy hitch with easy installation.", "unixReviewTime": 1512259200}

Most battery chargers can be annoying, especially these smart chargers but they do what they do mostly to protect the user and the battery. Most batteries have issues with charging because the voltage is too low and or you choose too fast of a charge rate. Charging severely discharged batteries is difficult whether it be a smart or a dumb charger.\n\nHere is the procedure for charging 12v batteries that are very discharged with a standing voltage of less than 9V. First you attach the battery charger to the dead battery. Then, with some jumper cables, attach a mostly charged battery (around 12v) to the dead battery in parallel using the jumper cables (Positive to Positive, Negative to Negative). The charger should detect a voltage of 12v, then charge at the lowest rate (2 amps) with this configuration for at least 3 hours. After 3 hours, you should be able to disconnect the \"good\" (charged) battery and be able to continue charging the \"bad\" (discharged) battery at the lowest charge rate. If you're desperate to get things up and running ASAP, wait until the battery is charged up to 11.8V then if you want, you can choose a higher charge rate. Don't choose a fast charge rate when bringing a severely discharged battery up to 11v otherwise you'll receive error codes.\n\nError codes are very common and you pretty much have to play around with it until it begins to charge.\n\nBattery chargers don't allow for charging of severely discharged batteries as a precaution because they don't want people charging 6V batteries accidentally or creating sparks by having it output 10a of electricity when there isn't anything hooked up. I've successfully charged about 15 car batteries with about 8 of them below 3V, some as low as 0V with this method. These chargers work great, it's just that you have to understand how they work in order to get them to do what you want.", "summary": "These chargers are good but have some caveats", "unixReviewTime": 1278460800}

Different electronics.  Different lamp reflectors.  This may work in one car, and not another.  Simple problems like hyper-flashing are easy to fix.  I've heard of all kinds of issues from simple \"plug & play\" installations.  People have reported that their cruise control unit failed after installing a LED lamp.\n\nWhen I installed LED lamps on my car, the obvious problem occurred. \"Hyper-Blinking\". All lamps turned on, and flashed extremely fast.\n\nMy next solution was to use a LED Decoder 3157a Adapter, also sourced from Amazon. \"Hyper-Blinking\" was solved. But now, there were other issues. I signal left, or signal right, all lights would flash like hazard lights. My dash lights would go on, and my odometer would dim, with each flicker and flash. If I applied the brakes, the front signal lights would burn steady like the rear brake lights. If my headlamps were turned on, then signaling, braking, and turning on the hazard light switch would only turn the lamps on to high, and stay on as if brakes were being applied, without any flashing.\n\nOn my car, the solution was a Tridon EP27 flasher relay.\n\nI installed this unit into the tail lights for brakes and reverse, and the front signal lamp.  In the tail lamp, the white light behind the red lens works just fine.  The reverse lights are brighter, way brighter, than the OEM lamps.  The OEM front signal lamp is a yellow light bulb, which also doubles as a parking lamp.  Be sure that you are not violating any local ordinances prior to installation.  Your local jurisdiction may not be happy with a white light facing forward and flashing.  Your local constable may issue a citation for modifying your vehicle with lights that did not come from the manufacturer.", "summary": "'07 Ford F-150", "unixReviewTime": 1415836800}

If you don't care about your vehicle that much and you just want a quick, cheap fix this will work for you.\nI purchased this for my 2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport\nHere are my issues with this part:\n1) The metal base that gets bolted to the vehicle is not coated in any way.  This will start to rust immediately.  The OEM part has a nice black epoxy finish.  The reason you are replacing the old one in the first place is because it most likely was rusted.\n2) The bolts that protrude through from the bottom are two mild steel bolts that have two tack welds holding them in place.  The problem with using the threw bolts like that is that it will never sit flush up against the 'frame' where it attaches.  This means water will sit up there, rust the part, and the frame.  The OEM part uses studs that have been recessed into the metal part and are completely flush with the back side.  In all the places I researched the Walker part you never see the tops of those bolts in the pictures (pretty sneaky).\n3) This part comes dissembled.  The OEM part comes assembled.\n\nI hope this helps the next person make the correct choice. There are lots of places to buy Mopar parts online, I would start there you can get the part number from any parts place or your service manual.

I was searching Amazon for what I hoped might help me adapt a standard tow bar to my tractor and came across this item which is exactly what I needed. The product appears to be well built and is a great value for the price!  I have two trailers (one with 1-7/8' ball and one with 2' ball) and was pleased to be able to move either one without having to change the tow bar.  Having this on the 3 point hitch also allowed me to \"disconnect\" from one trailer and \"connect\" to another without having to adjust the tongue jacks on the trailers; just lower, back under and raise.  This item is perfect for what I need to do!\n\nONE WORD OF CAUTION:  Be sure this item is level and \"locked in\" with the 3 Point hitch linkage so that it cannot move or rotate during use.  I neglected to do this the first use and bent my trailer coupler because the tow bar was able to sway and rotate in the 3 point hitch.\n\nONE LAST CAUTION:  After a few uses, I noticed the hitch balls had come loose; evidently not tightened sufficiently when the item was assembled.  No bit deal to tighten but keep and eye out to be sure yours have not become loose!", "summary": "Great value for the money!", "unixReviewTime": 1464652800}

Wrapping it tight on the drum will keep the rope from burying itself when its put under a load. Just tie off to a truck and have a buddy lightly brake while you guide the rope on the spool.

My first pair went on a 2012 Jeep Unlimited Sport on the pillars. They were rock solid, low profile, bright as hell, basically indestructible and drew less power than HIDs or Halogens. I used them off roading, going hunting, camping, fishing, and occasionally to see where i'm going down dark rural roads. I loved these so much that I bought this pair off of Amazon for my 2014 Jeep Unlimited Rubicon. These are a must for any outdoor enthusiast that uses their vehicle in their \"play\" environment. (or work environment). Keep in mind, these lights are BRIGHT!! You will not be able to (legally) use these in the city, especially at oncoming traffic.\n\nThe supplied harness is easy to install directly to your battery. The harness includes the relay, in-line fuse, switch and enough wire length to probably run these lights to the rear of your vehicle. Just have some black zip ties handy to keep your wires secure as you snake them through your engine compartment and firewall. I wired my lights to a Rugged Ridge A Pillar Switch pod that you can purchase here on Amazon. (if you have a Jeep JK)\n\nRigid Industries durability is second to none. If you haven't seen some of their strength/endurance testing on their lights, you should look it up on YouTube.\nThis is a little more expensive than other off road style lights, but the perforamance value is well worth it.", "summary": "Super bright and easy install!", "unixReviewTime": 1388361600}

It is much more evident when illuminating a solid white object than anything else. If those who haven't noticed it would hold up a sheet of white paper anywhere the light shines I'd almost guarantee they'd see it clearly. We have several white surfaces in our camper where I installed three of these and the projected patterns was very annoying. The yellowish bands are about the same color as white plastic after it has aged, so not only is the pattern itself distracting, whatever it's shining on looked old and dreary too. So I was in a quandary trying to decide if the much brighter output, lower power consumption and heat was worth enduring, and hopefully getting accustomed to the banding. I decided to try to figure out the source of the pattern, presuming at first that it was the small cross-hatch pattern molded into the lens cap. Some testing by holding up a white nylon cutting board while covering various portions of the lens though, proved this not to be the case. It is actually being cause by the arrangement of the individual LED elements as their light passes through the clear focusing lens in the center of the lens cap. This focusing lens is presumably there to direct light downward onto anything directly below it, and would probably work perfectly well with a single bulb, but with an array of LEDs it creates an effect that was surely unanticipated and for many, I'm sure, will be unwelcome. Thankfully, once I understood the problem, with a little experimenting I found a solution that was very acceptable for me. All I did was cut a paper towel the size of the oval focusing lens and then separated the plies of the paper and put a single ply between the LED array and the lens cap. This serves as a suitable defuser and the lines are completely eliminated without appreciably decreasing the light output. The LEDs run super cool so I can't believe there could be a heat issue with this solution but I'll be checking it later to make sure and would recommend you do the same if you decide to try it. I may try to come up with something else besides paper to serve as the defuser as I guess there are a lot of translucent materials that would work as well. Just a frosted sheet of plastic would probably be ideal. Anyway, I hope this helps for others who have experienced this and would like a cheap, easy fix.", "summary": "Light pattern hack...", "unixReviewTime": 1480032000}

The solar charger has a negative male on the disconnect plug, so it needs a negative female on the Battery Tender to plug into.  However, the Battery Tender 2-pin quick disconnect plug is wired up with a positive female, so instead of charging the battery when they are connected, it actually drains it.  We took this Battery Tender quick disconnect off our generator battery and instead used the alligators clips that came with the solar panel trickle charger, and it is charging perfectly now.

AGAIN!  Different Jeep though. There is that monument when you start the jeep and it just takes off, it was an indication of a problem. The clutch had very little action and that only near the floor. As I left and headed out in 5 oclock traffic I soon discovered that shifting and stopping were going to be an issue. I drove home in 3rd gear slowing to avoid a stop and stall. Under the transmission bell at the seam there was some fluid dripping. This was my second clue.  Here is the list of tools and part numbers to get the repair done.\n\nPros:\nQuick shipping.\nPerfect fit.\nEasy to bleed.\nAll parts included.\n\nCons:\nIt needs a zip tie thing that snaps off after inserted like on a YJ.\nGetting it to compress and line up is hard if pre-bled.\n\nTools needed:\n13 MM deep socket\n6 inch extension\nRatchet\nSmall flathead.\nDOT3 fluid.\nDrip pan. Place pan under cylinder to catch fluid.\n\nStep one:\nRemove two nuts holding clutch cylinder to transmission. Unhook any cables in the way.\n\nStep two.\nUse small flat head to remove retaining clip on top where line connects.\nTwist and pull, watch out to make sure rubber fitting is not damaged, you may need that.\n\nStep three.\nAttach new cylinder and secure with hairpin clip. The line needs to be pushed completely in or it will pop out.\n\nStep four.\nBleed cylinder by pushing plunger in slowly till you cant hear air bubbles passing through to reservoir. This took around 15 times for me. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE FLUID IN THE RESERVOIR.\n\nStep five.\nMake sure plunger is properly aligned and push towards mounting bolts. Check to see if line bracket is lined up with holes on side of cylinder.\n\nStep six.\nTighten bolts and secure all disconnected components.\n\nStep seven.\nBleed cylinder as needed. If needed have someone push the clutch in as you open the valve to let any air bubbles out.  Just like brakes.\n\nCheck to see if clutch is properly working and no grinding occurs when shifting.  If all goes well there should be no fluid on the lower portion of the transmission bell and you should be good to go.", "summary": "Fixing a clutch slave cylinder in a 2007 Wrangler", "unixReviewTime": 1521417600}

I used a small compressor and the 1/4\" connector.  That and some teflon tape had me up and running in just a few minutes.\n\nHooked up to a small 1.5hp air compressor (i think maxes out around 90psi) - what i use for airing up tires.\n\nAlmost worked too well!  I nearly ran my small reservoir dry a couple times (on 3 motorcycles).  Takes a bit of getting used to the flow rate of the vacuum and is easy to run the reservoir dry.  Rate of suction and flow rate are adjusted by how much you squeeze the handle - just some fine tuning and getting used to it.\n\nCompared w/ my Mityvac MV8000 - it's far easier.  (it does require an air compressor though).  Also i like the quality flexible (Silicone?) hoses that came with this unit WAY BETTER than the hard lines of the mityvac!!\n\nIf i were to nit-pick a little, i think the overall unit is well made.  A gauge would be helpful to give me a measurement to target vacuum (which equals flow rate) so i don't over-draw and run the reservoir dry.  Small gripe, and honestly i just needed a helper or to stop and top off more frequently.  It's hard to complain about it being too easy and fast... but that's pretty much the only negative.\n\nI looked at the Mityvac vacuum ($$$ air compressor assisted) units.  This unit (only being about the same price as the MV8000 (also the cheapest mityvac \"kit\") which i have already), and the better quality hoses - this is hands down a better option.  And if it fails in a year i'd still have to buy several before it cost as much as the assisted vacuum Mityvac ones.\n\nHighly recommend.", "summary": "Almost too good - need a larger reservoir!", "unixReviewTime": 1404172800}
