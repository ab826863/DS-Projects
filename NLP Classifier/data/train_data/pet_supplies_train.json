Van Til", "reviewText": "I've become more and more unhappy with most of the basic cat food one can buy at grocery and big-box stores. Recently I noticed that most of them contain fish, regardless of the flavor the can says they are. And feeding cats fish every day is not a good practice. Then there's all kinds of other junk in most of that food, junk that is unhealthy at best; and appalling at worst. (And that's not even talking about dry cat food.) So I've been looking for something better which doesn't cost a fortune. When you're feeding six cats about 1/2 can each, twice a day, that's a lot of food; and a lot of money. Our cats' health is more important than money -- but you do have to be able to pay what it costs, and a lot of it is grossly over-priced, in my view.\n\nI like the fact that this Instinct beef doesn't contain fish, guar gum and other starches, nor coloring. The latter makes it  look weird (grayish-mud-brown), and quite unappetizing; but then, I'm not the one eating it! (It doesn't smell particularly good, either.) What I don't like is that it does contain stuff like flax seed, tomato, pumpkin, cranberries, broccoli, cabbage, kale, parsley. At least those are foods -- human foods! -- and not chemicals, but, come on, Nature's Variety, those are just not things that cats naturally eat. (Cats are obligate carnivores: they eat, and must eat, meat; period.) So what are these human vegetables doing in a \"premium\" cat food? That makes no sense to me, except for the company to save money on that last 5% of ingredients instead of making it all meat.\n\nI recently bought a good meat grinder and am now using home-ground chicken (with the ground bones and giblets and an additional nutritional supplement) as the basis for my cat food, which is healthier and much cheaper than commercial food. I haven't gone raw yet (a couple of the  cats didn't like raw when I tried it on them) but we're working toward that. At this point I'm adding some commercial cat food to my chicken in their transition, and may continue to do that for some time.

I read about alternatives for a litter mat such as car mats and yoga mats. I've been using an old towel to catch litter but since my cat missed the box one morning, I ended up tossing the darn thing. I had to wash the towel once or twice a week in the laundry which was already annoying. Sweeping a towel wasn't exactly the easiest thing either. I even used trash bags as a temporary mat while I waited for this product to arrive. Though other options were more cost effective, I ended up buying this to give it a try and it looked very stylish in photos. I also had a gift card to spare.\n\nIt arrived rolled up like a yoga mat wrapped in plastic. It certainly had a smell that filled up the room it was in but it has disappeared after a full day of use. I wish the corners weren't rounded and I might end up cutting it to fit into the corner of the room. I really appreciate it's large size since I don't need to barricade the litter box anymore to prevent litter from spreading. The litter, I have noticed, isn't really contained more than the setup I had before, but it just has more of a surface area that the litter is allowed to be on (the mat), if that makes sense. I kind of imagine it as: as long as the litter is on the mat and not on the floor, it's good to go.\n\nOne thing I really like about this mat is that it is really easy to sweep and clean. I simply slide the dust pan under the corner of the mat and sweep everything into it. And I'd imagine the process of cleaning it as described by the company (wipe with sponge) is also easy. The rigidity of the mat is helpful as opposed to the flimsy towel I had before...but I'd imagine other mat-like products having this same quality. Since it is easier for me to clean up, the litter is less likely to continue spreading throughout the day which probably explains why the area has been near spotless. I would be sweeping 4-5 times a day but now I sweep once in the morning and once before bed (and I'm a neat freak).\n\nThe litter I am using is Precious Cat which is very heavy and has larger granules than other cat litters. I am switching to Integrity cat litter in a few days which is very fine, like sand. I am not sure if the type of litter affects the effectiveness of this product but I'll update if there's any change! Right now, I am happy with this product since it is so much more efficient than the towel I had. It matches well in the room and is easier on my knees than the hardwood floor/carpet when I'm sweeping. But I'm sure I would have gotten similar results with a yoga mat.\n\nEdit: So with the new Integrity litter, I absolutely hated this stuff. It was all over and I don't really blame the mat since the litter was so sandy. It was also horribly dusty! After finishing the bag, I tried Integrity Natural Wheat which had larger granules similar to World's Best but better in my opinion. Now that I am happy with my litter, I can say that this mat is not a amazing. It is not a forcefield.

As soon as I brought the Amazon box into my house, my two Maine Coon boys started going nuts, meowing and prowling around it.

I put a spoonful of it on each of their cardboard scratchers and one in their big catnip fish (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072VD63L8/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and they went absolutely nutter. They are still spazing as I write this.\n\nAs far as the consistency, the batch I received is fine-milled rather than being stem-and-leaf. It actually looks like it was run through a coffee mill. I (and my cats, as far as I can tell) have no preference as to consistency, so this doesn't matter to me at all. I very much appreciate that the 'nip is in a resealable bag; the last batch I bought from a different company was in an awkward plastic cup with a lid that wouldn't stay on. I've made sure to put it in a locking cabinet that the cats cannot break into.\n\nOf note - I have a female DMH calico who is not affected by catnip. It has nothing to do with the quality of the herbs. Some cats do not have the gene that makes them react to catnip, and kittens do not have the olefactory development necessary to process catnip. So if your cat doesn't react to this or any other 'nip products, you probably have a kitty teetotaler.

Don't judge me.\n\nSurprisingly, this particular toy (named Jack-ay) has only had his stuffing completely removed and a few \"hairs\" from his mane pulled out.

The squeaker in the body was pulled out with all the stuffing but his feet still squeak.\n\nAs much as we've enjoyed it, all I have to say is buy at your own risk.

However, she can still run like the wind, but I know that shoulder really hurts her. So I've been putting the Pettura liquid supplement in her dog food and hope it really helps her to be in less pain and have better mobility after resting for a long period. The Pettura is a combination of glucosamine, chondroitin, and MSM. I have personally tried these same products in the past for my arthritis, but I didn't see any improvement for me. However, I have rheumatoid arthritis rather than osteo so that's the reason these supplements didn't work for me.

The following is my unbiased eview based on testing them out.\n\nThe pros with these gloves is they are more comfortable to wear than typical silicone gloves. The fabric lining inside kept my hands from sticking to the silicone as happens in unlined gloves. Depending on the humidity in the kitchen, silicone gloves and mitts can be hard to get on in a hurry. (Those cookies you forget while doing something else can't wait while you struggle to get a glove on your hand!)\n\nThe gloves are well made, I did not find any defects. The gloves include a tag with washing instructions telling you to hand wash and hang dry.\n\nThe gloves do not have an odor to them. (Being sensitive to odors, I try to always mention this because I know there are others who get headaches from chemical smells.)\n\nThey are pretty. The gloves are ambidextrous and can be worn on either hand. Major bonus if you have seconds to pull those cookies out before they burn. There are raised silicone ridges that help keep your hand from being in direct contact with the hot pan. The gloves covered my wrists well so I will not have burn lines across those.\n\nNow, on to practicality... These gloves DO work, but with a few warnings.\n\nDespite the inner padding, these gloves are very thin. They are not as thick as most fabric oven mitts. The quilted padding adds comfort vs real longer protection from burns.\n\nWhat this means for is that YES, you can pick up a pan that has been in a 450 degree oven, but, you still cannot hold that pan for more than five to fifteen seconds, depending on your sensitivity to heat. This is not a problem in many cases while cooking, you are usually simply moving the pan to a resting spot outside the oven. This doesn't take more than a few seconds. BUT, if you needed to hold that hot pan to pour something, or to steady the pan, or to hold the handle of a cast iron skillet, this could become a problem. Value and heat protection are judged based on what you need the gloves to move.\n\nI am rating these gloves as three stars because they are good gloves but only okay for protecting against heat. I expected thicker gloves that would allow me to handle a hot pan for longer before my hand started to feel burned. Despite Amazon's lame rating system, three stars is NOT a critical review. It means the product does it's job, but I don't feel it is worth raving about for a reason I mention in my review.\n\nWould I purchase these gloves again? Yes. But, I would purchase them knowing they should not be the only oven mitts in my drawer. They do not provide enough heat protection for jobs where I need to hold a hot pan for more than 15 seconds. They also won't work for handling hot preserve jars. I will be keeping these and will honestly be using them, they are very nice gloves. They look great and are easy to wear, and provide short term heat protection.\n\nI will also say the following, the thinner padding makes the gloves easier to use for everyday use. I was able to grip the cookie sheet and the muffin tin without fumbling. A thicker padding would have made that a bit awkward.\n\nI hate say I am an expert in oven mitts and gloves, but I own around ten pairs. All have good and bad points. I keep three pair in my daily use drawer and the others in the linen closet or with the camping gear. I have even taken pairs of my favorite gloves to houses where I cook more than once a month because I am a glove snob. I dislike using gloves that don't work for the job I am doing, or using gloves with holes burnt through them. If I am standing at the sink cooling a burn, my food could be burning.\n\nYour perception of these gloves might be better or worse than mine and that's okay. I write my reviews based on my own personal opinion after trying an item. What I perceive as a bonus might be a con for you or vice versa.", "summary": "The inner padding makes them easier to slip on and off", "unixReviewTime": 1449273600}

However, since my little dog has so many health issues, it came to a point where I had to try something to remove all that plaque build up he has on his teeth. The first week I got the powder, I tried to remove the plaque but it clinged to the teeth as if it was stuck to it with glue. By the end of the second week, some of the plaque chipped away easily. We are now at the 6th week. All of his front teeth are plaque free and I am working on the large back buildup he has on there. Most of it is chipped/chizzeld away but I have a huge plaque buildup piece on the other back side that I am going to continue to try and break away from his teeth.\n\nMy observation is that this supplement makes it easier to break and \"chizzle\" away the plaque pieces off the dog's teeth.\n\nThere's still some slight residue on the bigger front teeth that I am hoping would go away completely over time with some good brushing.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this to anyone with a pet. At hindsight I wish I new about it a long time ago, when I just got my dog. I truly believe he would have had no plaque buildup at all by simply adding this as a supplement on a daily basis (which is what I plan to do going forward.\n\nI wish I had a before and after picture.

I ran out of my usual litter (Costco) and got this to fill in. Eeechhh!  STINKS!  Smells like someone broke a bottle of cheap perfume in the house. I know how sensitive cat noses are, and I felt guilty even pouring a little in their box. They must have had to hold their breaths, because I couldn't breath around this stuff. Second: dust! Again, between the strong perfume and dust, this was a killer. I was gagging and sneezing trying to pour this.  I have asthma, so it \"litter-ally\" was killing me.\n\nThird and most important: I ran across some blogs that warned about the dangers of clumping clay and silica litters. My youngest of my three cats is almost 10--they've been using clumping clay all their lives. I lost one two years ago to severe respiratory problems and I never connected it to the litter. I can't prove it anyway.\n\nHowever, my other cat developed a slight cough (which he never did before) so I took him in (after Cujo died at age 7, I wait for nothing to take them to the vet). After an Xray is was determined that he his windpipes were so inflamed he was having trouble breathing. The vet told me to switch litters immediately. The benzonite silica in these clumping clay litters that causes the clumping is attracted to moisture and clumps immediately. When you or your cat breathe it it, it attempts to \"clump your lungs\" my vet told me. Of course it's made worse with covered boxes (I have the Booda dome). The damage is irreversible. Additionally, the dust from these litters gets on your cat's fur and is licked off. This stuff eventually ends up in the gut, where it does not move or dissolve, but merely builds up to block digestion. And one more, the clay must be strip mined, and cannot be recycled or composted or flushed...so back to the landfill it goes. I used to toss 2-3 pounds of clay-clumped pee and poo daily with 3-4 cats. I switched to Feline Pine, and now toss about 3 oz. of sawdust and poo daily. Big difference. If I had a garden I could compost it. Or flush it, but I would advise anyone against flushing litter, especially in CA: goes straight to the ocean and there's some big movement about how flushable litters kill sea otters...but that's another story.", "summary": "Zero Stars: damages health", "unixReviewTime": 1220140800}

Took it off charger and it dropped to 2 within a short amount of time.

I don't even have it on her when there is significant rainfall.\n\nI called Dogtra today and was told I have to send it in to be inspected by their repair center. Customer pays for shipping.

Of course, that means to mount it - it's gonna require mounting it on something sturdy as well otherwise the weight alone will pull it down.  Everything needed to mount it is also included.  Also, note it is weather resistant, not weather proof - meaning it would be best to install under an eve, etc. to keep out of direct rain, snow, etc.  I think the pic is great.  I really like how you can easily walk around the house and take the little monitor (referred to as owners unit) with you (pocket maybe?) - then you can use it's little kickstand to prop it wherever you want to sit it for monitoring.  It has a rechargeable battery, so mobility is not an issue.\n\nThe camera can be controlled from the monitor (owners unit).  It can be zoomed in and out and actually turned up, down, left and right.  A little con of zooming in and out does require hitting the menu button and actually choosing 1x or 2x zoom - so the zooming feature is not really anything to write home about so to speak.  The menu also offers a way to brighten the display, which is a nice option.  You can also add 3 more cameras to the owners unit.  If you purchase/add the indoor pet camera with sound, you can actually use the microphone talk option to speak via the monitor and transmit to the camera.  This system did not come with the indoor pet unit, so I can not review that portion.  Also, some have mentioned they were able to monitor sound?  All I can hear from the speaker via the owners unit is static - I have not observed any \"realtime or real life\" sound.?  I just assumed the outdoor camera did NOT have any sound? If it is supposed to, then this unit is broken.\n\nThe monitor (owners unit) pic can be viewed thru your tv by purchasing a special video cable.\n\nImportant notes:  If you are looking for a camera that works via the internet, etc. - this one is NOT for you.  This works within the wireless range of under 600 ft only - it does not have a wifi or internet ability.  So, overall if you are wanting to view your backyard via the internet on your pc or phone away from home, this one is not for you.  If however, you will be at home and just need to keep an eye on the backyard, frontdoor, etc. without having to get up and run to look out, this is perfect.", "summary": "Great pic and love the camera controls!", "unixReviewTime": 1390435200}

My long-haired collie still barks but it's certainly better with the collar than without.  It also seems to work better when she has a summer hair cut as the metal probes can reach her skin more easily.\n\nThe other drawback of this collar is that the on/off/setting button is ANNOYING. Older models had a dial you could turn. On this model, you push and hold a little button for 2-3 seconds, let go, and the setting changes. For example, to change from correction level 1 to 2, you have to press and hold the button for 2-3 sec, then let go.  If you want correction level 3, you have to do it again. After correction level 3, pressing the button and releasing takes you to Test mode. Then you can press it again to turn it off.  Cycling through all of these settings is slow and frustrating, especially since you might release the button too soon (setting doesn't change) or you might hold it in too long.\n\nTIP:\nI have discovered a trick that I'm not sure is explained in the instructions.  You can avoid cycling through all of these levels if e.g., your dog always needs correction level 3. When you're ready to turn the collar off, press and keep holding the button until you see if flash green, and then red (do NOT let go after it flashes green). When it flashes red, the unit is off. To turn it back on, press the button twice, and it will automatically take you back to the level you used last. [If I hadn't discovered this 'feature' of the collar, I think I would have given up on it a long time ago.]\n\nOVERALL:\nI would still buy this collar. I trust the brand in terms of my pet's safety.  I just wish it were more effective at curbing the barking and that it weren't so annoying to use.", "summary": "Dog still barks (but not as much); On/off/setting button is annoying", "unixReviewTime": 1308873600}

We have a [stupidly friendly] young black lab/shar pei mix who's stoutly shaped, and we've had quite a few people act intimidated by him.

The only thing I would change is the distance from the clip that the first word is sewn- it's a little too far up, so if you're holding your dog close with the leash in your hand (normal for crowded/high-traffic places), the word friendly is in your hand and not visible a little lower on the lead, which (with a corrective collar) puts you right back at looking like you're trying to control an unfriendly dog in a crowded place.\n\nThe squishy handle is awesome, but largely doesn't get used when we're holding the excess leash of a heeling dog.", "summary": "Clear, plentiful word stitching, bright color, great length", "unixReviewTime": 1449532800}

We had been feeding her Taste of the Wild, which is a great, high-quality food, but my vet explained that some cats just have urinary issues and require special diets as a result. The vet sent us home with an expensive bag of Purina's urinary care prescription formula, which seemed to help her urinary crystals issue (no more peeing outside of the litter box), but resulted in awful, smelly, loose stools. This isn't too surprising, as the vet's food didn't have nearly as good a mix of protein and fat without grain that she had been getting.\n\nI began scouring the internet for a high-quality, urinary-tract-friendly cat food. I happened upon the Wysong website and was happy to discover this product. We ordered both the dry and wet uretic formula foods and were delighted when our kitty fell immediately in love with both. We soon discontinued feeding her the wet food, as it also caused her stool to smell terrible (differently than the vet's prescription food). The vet was impressed at how well she was doing at her annual check-up, 6 months after we began this diet, so we will keep feeding it as long as her health checkups are clean.\n\nIMPORTANT KITTY HEALTH NOTE: When feeding your cat this diet, it is incredibly important that you provide him or her with lots and lots of fresh, clean water in multiple vessels that your cat finds appealing.\n\nOne of the ways that this type of food works to improve urinary health is by triggering your cat's thirst. In the wild, a cat's primary source of hydration is through its food, so unless your cat eats an exclusively canned or raw diet, he or she is probably not getting enough water. Dehydration aggravates the tendency for cats to develop urinary issues, which is why it is so important to encourage your cat to drink enough water. The food alone is not enough, though. You must also do your part to ensure that your cat has plenty of clean, fresh water. Remember that cats are generally very picky when it comes to their water (as they are with everything else in their lives), and you may need to try out different types of bowls, pails, and/or fountains to find what your cat likes best. We noticed a marked increase in the amount of water our kitty was drinking after putting her on this food, as well as the amount of urine in the litter box. We provide her with plenty of fresh, clean water, and we haven't had any struvite flare-ups since.", "summary": "Great Urinary Care Food, But Provide Lots of Water!", "unixReviewTime": 1421107200}

I'm a neat freak and can't stand bad smells. This pellet system is phenomenal! The only time you smell anything is when there is a fresh poop and they don't bury it or when the pee pad needs to be replaced. I have found its best to wait a little bit to scoop the poop if its fresh. A few pellets might cling and can just get thrown away with the poop. The pee goes right through to the pad and there is zero odor.\n\nOne of the best things I found out is that these can be cleaned and re-used!!! I have a big soup pot designated just to cleaning the pellets. I boil them once a month with a little bleach for about 30 minutes, drain and put them in a large bin to dry out. They stay 100% intact and I have reused the same pellets for 3 months.

MEDIA IS INCLUDED -- a large bag of carbon; a bag of ceramic rings; a few handfuls of \"bio balls\", plus coarse and fine mesh pads. I employed all of it, plus an extra bag of carbon, 500 ml of Purigen, (in Seachem's 'The Bag') and a bag of Matrix.\n\nTHE MINUSES:\n1.) The instructions are no better than a \"guide\", so you'll have to figure a few things out on your own. There are no suggestions on filling it with aquarium water before you attempt to prime it, but I highly recommend that you do, or you'll be pushing the priming-plunger for quite a while.\n2.) The hosing is stiff and \"unfriendly\". It comes coiled up in the box, and has a \"memory\", so it won't straighten, and you'll find that it fights against your efforts to direct it where you want it to go. It's also very difficult to push the hose ends over the tank nozzle barbs, which are slightly oversized. I held the hose-ends under hot running water to soften them up, and they slipped on a little easier. The canister nozzles are not oversized, so no problem there.\n3.) Make sure you remove the gummy-plastic end-protector on the UV bulb. The instructions don't mention it.\n4.) The UV bulb \"On\" indicator light is only visible if you look directly down on it. It'll be easy to forget that it's on.\n\nTHE PLUSSES:\n1.) Fantastic filtration capacity!! The four large baskets hold all the medium I need or want.\n2.) Extremely quiet!! The only way I know it's running, is either by touching it, or observing the surface current in the aquarium. It's hard to believe that something so quiet, could be moving 525 gallons per hour, or roughly 9 gallons a minute.\n3.) Although the suction tube and spray-bar are flimsy, they afford some choice in arangement, length, and placement.\n4.) Although the hoses are stiff, they're quite lengthy, and should suit the most remote location you can place the canister in relation to the aquarium.\n5.) Any filter that generates UV clarification is an excellent addition to any aquarium. My fish were \"flashing\" due to an unknown cause. But after a day of filtration with the UV on, the flashing has stopped. Water is also very clear, and odor-free.\n\nFYI:\nThe UV bulb is not 'instant-ON'. It may take 10 seconds or more for the indicator light to flicker and turn on.\n\nI'm very happy with it.\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n5 Stars\n\n[UPDATE, June 15th]:\nIf connected to smaller aquariums, use of the UV could raise water temperature a few degrees after several hours.\n\n[UPDATE, Aug 13th]:\nI've noticed a slight harmonic 'buzz', which I think is a high frequency interaction between hard media (ceramic rings) and the plastic baskets, or between the baskets themselves. I suppose the only way to prevent it would be to have gaskets or O-rings between baskets. No big deal, but I thought I'd mention it.\n.", "summary": "Excellent and QUIET!!", "unixReviewTime": 1401926400}

Cans", "Flavor Name:": " Ocean Whitefish & Spinach"}, "reviewerName": "Alexander Lucard", "reviewText": "We have three cats. One is 14, the second is a year and a half and the third is just four and a half months. The two younger cats prefer kibble to wet food BIG TIME with the middle cat regularly refusing wet food unless it is one of four kinds: Newman's Own organic Turkey, Addiction's Buffalo Safari and finally, Avoderm's Swordfish and Sardines brands. Because of this the other two cats (oldest and youngest) have likewise learned to turn their nose up at cat foods with byproducts or lesser quality ingredients. Somehow we have raised Portlandia style cats.\n\nI bring this up because Amazon Vine sent me a twelve pack of Purina Beyond to review. The flavor was Whitefish and Spinach and it contained no byproducts. grains, corn, wheat, soy preservatives, artificial flavors or added colours. This sounded like it would be right up our cats' alley, as well as our own as we want them to eat healthy, not the equivalent of cat McDonalds. We were a little worried though because Purina tends to make lesser quality cat foods. Friskies, Whiskas, and Cat Chow are not foods our cats like, nor are they brands we would feel comfortable giving to them because of the ingredients. Like I said, those brands are generally fast food for cats and they smell funky to boot. Purina One is grain free, but that's about all it has going for it.\n\nWell our cats ended up really liking Purina Beyond. Well, two of the three anyway. All three loved the liquid sauce they came in and lapped it up right away. Shelly, the eldest cat devoured her bowl full. Malice, the picky middle cat lapped up all the sauce and when that was done, she took a bit of the actual food and decided she'd rather have her Royal Canin kibble. That's okay, because She;; ate her can for her. The Kitten, Angel of Music, was really excited for her first ever taste of non-kitten food. She ate it pretty handily, especially the sauce but she didn't finish it. She's only a five pound baby after all. The next morning about half the can was left, compared to the wet kitten food she usually finishes off (Royal Canin Kitten Instinctive and Wellness Kitten).\n\nThe next day only one of the cats (Shelly) showed any interest in trying the cat food again but she was quite half to pick and choose from all three bowls. The younger two cats had no interest in trying it again. At least they gave it a chance unlike most wet cat foods. So it made a good first impression with all three, but had diminishing returns after that. Maybe their third and fourth servings will fare better.\n\nIngredient-wise the food is quite good. While not organic, which will be a stickler for some cat owners. The first white ingredients are Whitefish, Turkey, Liver, Fish Broth and Spinach. After that we get carrots, \"egg product\" and various minerals and additives cats need like taurine. So while, good, it's not AS GOOD as some other brands. It's light years beyond what Purina usually puts out though.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with this. Purina has stepped up their game and produced a quality cat food we don't have a problem feeding our cats and they more or less accepted it, which is far better than most other wet cat foods have fared in this household. While there are better options out there, I can definitely recommend this to cat owners everywhere, especially those with less picky cats.", "summary": "This sounded like it would be right up our cats' alley", "unixReviewTime": 1418083200}

They also didn't look like they were that comfortable for him, because they don't go up very high, so the straps hit right where his leg would bend and when they're very tight, as they have to be to have any hope of staying on, he was walking on tiptoes (tippaws?).

When I noticed that they changed the weight inside the bags (small ones now 4.5 instead of 5 lb in the same size bag, for instance), I thought it was a simple price hike.\n\nHowever, my dog who throws herself on anything edible in her path just looked at me and only reluctantly ate some of it after encouragement. I continued to give it to her for one more day, and thought she acted weird around it. When she got stomach/digestion issues and a UTI, meaning the food was affecting her kidneys, I emailed Natural Balance. They won't tell you anything in written, and arrange for a phone call instead. After some prodding, they admitted that some ingredients are now sourced in China. She would not give me a complete list, but I know for sure the vitamin C comes from there. She insisted that the recipe did not change, however, the new food is darker and much greasier to the touch, and when I tasted the old and new kibble (I love my dog, what can I say!), the new one tastes different. I returned the rest of the bag and now have a real problem finding something that will work for her.\n\nToo bad. NB's  sale to DelMonte, a multinational company, ruined a great product that I thought we'd use for the rest of my dog's life. There are reports of dogs falling ill after consuming the new NB recipes, so if your dog acts weird, stop giving it to them immediately.\n...........\nEdited to add\n1) Link to cosumer affairs complaints, which closely match my own experiences:\nhttp://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/natural_balance.html\n\n2) Reference to the NB Facebook page: If you want to read more, check their FB page. Customers are asking for answers again and again, and are being directed to a telephone number. Here are some comments from the past few days (I removed all names, since I don't know if it's OK to post them):\n.........................................\nI wrote to them after the DelMonte sale and asked if they could state that they would not import from China and she instructed me to call customer service, would not answer yes or no. A lot of premix vitamins come from China with God knows what else.\n5  October 30 at 6:12pm\n\nI'm very concerned since the sell. My dogs got sick in June and July. As did many of my friends dogs. I've lost my collie. I cannot get any information about the food. So exasperated.\nThe bag says manufactured in CA. Not very informative. For all I know the bag was made in CA.\n2  Yesterday at 5:24am\n\nDick Van Patten's Natural Balance Pet Foods, Inc. Hi (removed), our Customer Care team would be happy to answer any questions you may have about our formulas. Feel free to give them a call at (800) 829-4493.

She has a bad habit of running me instead of me walking her. Usually when this happens, she runs off. Unfortunately, she isn't trained to stay with me. She will run away, fast!

Since my grandkids also love them, I decided to get this for them and together we are learning how to maintain the aquarium and care for our fish.  So much fun setting the tank up together, researching about the best fish choices, and shopping for not only the fish but some decorative rocks and plants for their new \"home\".  And of course naming the fish - can't forget that.  (Can you say Dory, Nemo, Marlin, Destiny, and Mr. Ray?  What else.)\n\nBecause of its size, one can only put just a few fish in here and it pays to do a little research to find out which ones thrive in a small space like this, are easy to take care of, and are fun and/or pretty to look at.  We decided to start with the pretty little Neon Tetras and the bottom-feeding Cory Catfish.  So far all are doing fine, so of course we're delighted.\n\nQuite honestly, a really great little starter tank.  If all goes well, I can easily seeing us upgrading to larger tanks in the future so we can enjoy a wide variety of fish.

After keeping them in separate rooms for a couple of weeks, introducing their smells to each other, taking one in the other's room in a crate for short periods and vice versa, we began allowing them supervised time out together in the house.  Mayhem ensued.  Our vet recommended that we get a climbing tree so that one could have high territory while the other has the low ground.  We didn't want another big ugly carpet covered monstrosity in the house (we already have one and its enough!) so I looked for an alternative and found this.\n\nThis is a great alternative for our use.  My husband bolted it onto the side of our kitchen cabinets, and it allows the cat (or now, cats) to get to the top of the kitchen cabinets.  It is just the right depth to be out of the way, and we put the cats' food bowls underneath the bottom step.  It is unobtrusive enough not to be glaring in a room we live in all the time.  It is sturdy and holding up well.  We have had no trouble with the thin covering on the platforms tearing, but we keep the cats' claws trimmed regularly.  All cloth is still intact.\n\nThe only caveat I would give is that a grown, adult cat cannot sleep on any of the platforms.  Only a kitten could.  Our cats are ages 3 & 4, and they sit up on the platforms, but would fall off if they tried to stretch out there.  They do play on the unit now, with each on a different step, batting their paws at each other.  It's pretty adorable.  But mostly they use it for climbing up to get a better view of the place.  They do use it regularly, and we've now had it for several months.

I also dog-sit dogs at my house. So, at any given moment, I have between 3-6 dogs at my residence.\nMy yorkies are definite barkers. They bark at everything and anything. They bark at each other all the time (if one of them takes a toy another one wants... or, my favorite, if one of them is laying on a pillow or a spot on the couch another one wants. Once one of them starts barking, the others usually all follow. If I am not there to stop it, it can go on for HOURS.\n\nI moved into a townhouse recently and started to get REALLY anxious about leaving the house because there were multiple instances where I would come home and hear one of my dogs barking from the outside of the house. I can differentiate their barks (I know which one of them is barking and what type of bark they are using... like, they have an intruder bark, they have a annoyed bark, or they just have a bored bark, etc). My girl dog was barking her bored bark... the Bored Bark usually goes on for hours, there is no telling how long my neighbors must have been subjected to her barking. I was mortified.\n\nI tried setting up distractions for them while I leave the house. I don't leave the house a lot, I work from home, but I go out for about 2-3 hours a day to run errands or see people. So I tried giving them bones to gnaw on, toys filled with treats, anything. But they would just end up barking at each other because one of them would want the other one's toy.\n\nSo I finally got a shock collars. I tried it for a day and felt too bad. So I returned them.\n\nI also I purchased \"spray collars\". Those are coming tomorrow and I plan on using those in conjunction to this device. I also purchased muzzles and will be muzzling them if ever needed. Hey, it's better than getting complaints from neighbors and fines from the city and god knows whatever else. I have one neighbor who didn't say anything to my face about my dogs but who wrote a long complaint on Facebook about us.\n\nBut, anyway, I purchased this alongside my muzzles, and it works beautifully! one of my male terriers has high anxiety (he is scared of everything) and so I feel a little bad for him because he immediately jumps onto my lap and tries to hide his face in my shirt. The other two don't have anxiety but immediately stopped barking when this thing detected them. I manually pushed it today and all three of my dogs SCATTERED.\n\nI can hear the noise on some level. But then again, I am very young and my hearing is extremely good and I often hear high frequency pitches that others cannot.\n\nI have a frequent larger terrier that I look after (dog-sit) who loves to bark whenever I leave the house because she has separation anxiety. She has a deep, woofing bark that is much louder than my yorkies and much more annoying. She is over right now and this device immediately stops her barking as well.\n\nI think it is a hit-or-miss, completely depends on your dog type... but for my yorkies... It is working great and I am so happy. For the first time in weeks, I don't feel anxiety leaving the house. I actually finish all my errands and the thought of \"having to go home ASAP just in case they have started a barking war\" is no longer entering my mind. Even though I am only gone for 2-3 hours at a time, I still feel bad for my neighbors and truly just want my home to be quiet when I am gone. I even considered getting a two-way voice pet cam so I could check in and tell them to stop barking if needed. I might get one of those regardless, I am just so set on stopping this barking for the sake of my neighbors.\n\nAgain, I will update this review in about a month or so but I actually am thinking about purchasing several more of these for more coverage!", "summary": "yess!", "unixReviewTime": 1445472000}

I have one long haired cat and bought him a long hair Furminator, but he isn't all that crazy about it. He tolerates it for about 5 minutes and he is gone. When I bring it out, he disappears.\nSince reviewers stated this was specifically for long haired cats, I decided to try it.\nWhen unpaced it, the little metal spines which are to pull hair out looked terribly sharp. They were sligtly curved, but they still looked and felt awfully sharp.\nBefore I could, in good conscience, try this on my long haired grey, I gave it a tentative try on my own hair which is long. OUCH! It went directly into my scalp and hurt. It did not pull any of my loose hairs out, but then I do not have an undercoat, so I finally screwed up my courage and very gently tried it on the cat.\nIt pulled his regular hair and got a wee bit of undercoat off. I was a little more forceful. Some more undercoat came out, but the cat was not looking happy. At long last, I tried a regular \"pull\" through the hair. OUCH! The cat was off and hidden. He tried to give the thing a good biting on his way off the bed where I was holding him, but he missed. No matter. He hid.\nMy shourt haired cat is a lot tougher, so I gave it a try on her. With the furminator, she will sit for 20 minutes while I groom her.  But with this, OUCH! and she was gone. (Now, I realize it isn't for short hairs, but just as a comparison, I tried it.\nWell, this was a waste for me and my cat family. It hurt the long haired cat who will tolerate the Furminator. It hurt my head.\nI think it is an accident waiting to happen: scratched cat skin.

These pads are smaller than the ones here and look less \"neat\", but when my cat pees the pea only takes up about 4\" diameter circle, rather than spreading to 12\" diameter. I still need to spray them, but they are actually more economical in the long run.\n\nOriginal review:\nI use these pads for an erring kitty and they work great. They seem to contain the spill well because of the polymer gel inside. I just wish they would address the issue of a cat's particular urine smell and make these pads \"pet pads\" instead of just \"puppy pads\"", "summary": "Good for erring cats, too, but with a caveat", "unixReviewTime": 1370736000}

The moment it came I read the directions and then put it on him.  A contractor came over to install lighting and the second the dog saw him he started to bark.  He got the first tone and quieted down immediately.  After that, he got the tone two more times but didn't keep barking so it reset after a short interval.  That went on for a few days without he's getting any actual electric zap.  Yesterday, he kept barking when my husband came into the kitchen.  He got the zap and quieted down immediately.  Since then, he keeps it down with only an occassional grumble which doesn't seem to set off the collar.\n\nI put it on him if he starts to bark and it seems to be enough to remind him it's not a good behavior.  If you only want to correct the barking, this collar is a great tool.  You don't need to be there to initiate the correction and it's fairly humane in that it gives them two levels or warning before there is any physical correction.  My dog still lets me know if someone is at the door but it's just a low rumble and he quits right away.

Lady is an old dog with matted, extremely thick fur; Keesha is a young German Shepherd with medium length fur of medium thickness, and Jewel is a lab-pit mix with fine, very short fur.

The items were FURminator deShedding Ultra Premium Shampoo and the associated conditioner, the Deshedding Tool & Pet Grooming Tool For Small, Medium & Large Dogs from Dakcorp, the Safari Self-Cleaning Large Small Slicker Brush for Dogs from Safari, and the Oster Professional Pet Grooming Undercoat Rake, 18 Teeth Wide, Coarse by Jarden Consumer Solutions. All of the items worked to some degree, but some worked better than others. Here are my findings.\nI tried the tools on all the dogs before bathing and conditioning them with the FURminator. For the short-haired Jewel, only the Dakcorp tool did much. She had very little undercoat to start with, but the Dakcorp tool did get a little fur out, and it seemed to bother her less than the others. For Keesha, the Dakcorp and Safari tools worked about the same. I was happy with both of them. The Jarden Rake only worked with Lady and was the best tool for getting the initial undercoat out because the others grabbed too much fur at once and caused her obvious discomfort. After getting the majority out with the rake, the Dakcorp tool worked best for getting the remaining undercoat out. The Safari brush did not work very well on her fur.\nI noticed very little improvement in getting the fur out after using the Furminator shampoo and conditioner, but the dogs smelled awesome for about a week after.\nIm posting this same review under each of the items I used.", "summary": "Makes the dogs smell great, but it didn't a lot to make them shed more.", "unixReviewTime": 1402963200}

The Ovo Maze is a clever twist on the old notion of a maze: The dome is big enough to fit a 3-level cardboard maze in for lots of 3D exploration. In use it's a lot like an ant farm for hamsters. They go in and, depending on the maze, you can see your hamster duck in and out of a dollhouse or a treehouse or a fun beach scene. The beach scene comes with the Ovo but the additional maze inserts are so cheap you can easily collect them all. The inserts are chewable though my hamster isn't at all interested in chewing her maze. We put treats in it for her to find and that seems good enough for her.\n\nTechnically you could just put the insert in and shut the Ovo as-is but we put litter in the bottom level of ours for our hamster's comfort. She didn't like going through the down holes until the litter was put in. Now she sails through the whole thing like a pro. We attached the maze to her cage so she has four times the room to move about. The Ovo is bigger than I would have expected -- it's nearly the size of a full cage. I was able to hook it up to a non-Habitrail cage with some standard tubing purchased from the pet store. We also use the Ovo when we're cleaning her cage. Put a fresh veggie snack in the Ovo to distract her, shut the doorways out and she's got a safe place to hang out while her litter's being refreshed.\n\nWell worth the reasonable price for this super-fun item.

We followed the directions and after lathering our dog up well, we let the shampoo sit for 5 minutes and then rinsed well.  We brushed him before washing and then again before rinsing (shedding is also a problem for him).  It worked well at killing the fleas last fall and thus far has kept them away this summer.

It does not bother us, but it is a bit of a strong, obviously plant based smell.

Between the new environment, then being alone in it for a week before getting new \"neighbors\" (simply neon tetras to start since they \"get along\" with betas), he was really stressed and not himself at all- letting himself be sucked against the filter and just sitting there until I physically shook the filter, etc, basically, he seemed to be depressed and giving up (I know it may sound funny to most, but to anyone who has a betta, you know they have a personality like no other fish!). Not to mention, the leaning on the filter made his once beautiful fins get a shredded appearance. I honestly and truly thought he was on his last leg, but after giving the proper dose of this stuff for a week he was like a new fish! Swimming all over and more energetic than he'd EVER been. It's been over a month and he's still doing great, and still better than before this was given to him. His fins have come a long way too, but I've recently started a second \"round\" of this stuff (you give it every day for a week then take a break- according to directions) because they were pretty severely damaged during his depression/sickness and need to grow back over time. Regardless, I'm just happy his fins improved AT ALL and that he himself became better than ever before as far as health, energy, liveliness and playfullness. Thank god for this stuff!\n\n(PS- incase you were wondering: the other fish and creatures in the tank all reacted fine and even seemed a little more energetic themselves. At any rate, it DEFINITELY did no harm to the tetras, shrimp, dwarf water frog, the betta, nor the live plants).\n\nIf you're worried about your betta because he's acting odd, losing color or his fins are damaged- GET THIS PRODUCT!

The entire pad goes right into the washer and dryer.  I was able to put both of mine (small size) into the washer (as well as the dryer) at once.  These wash up beautifully, and come out super soft.

As our door is in a south facing wall, and gets direct wind and rain from our storms, I added a bead of caulk to the sides and top of the exterior frame for extra water protection. It should also be noted that the two door flaps always kept the weather out and the two slider doors keep the heat in and cold out in the winter, At about year 4-5, the original flaps were replaced due to the heavy wear and tear, and when the time finally came to replace the original door frame/tunnel, the only door I would consider was the same one, due to my complete satisfaction with the first.

I really love the harness and that it's lightweight and doesn't choke my dog, but it seems to be stretching out? and the black piping around the entire thing is coming unsewn.

I have a 55 gallon saltwater tank and the instructions for this item were spot on. Works as advertised. I used the \"B\" setup with both sensors in my tank and the hose from my pump and reservoir slightly above the fish tank. I have a sensor height differential of about 3-1/2\" and when the sensor #2 detected low level the pump started and when water reached float top sensor #1  the pump shut off immediately. Total of about 10 gallons. I have a 35 gallon reservoir that I bought here on Amazon and a transfer pump 120 volt, 2.0 amp, 350 gallons/hr. This setup topped off the tank in about 3 minutes.\nRemember guys, when you set up the sensors---the shut off will not occur until the float reaches the top--similar to the float in your toilet. So set your floats with room for play.\nPart 2 of review. Just tested system as water level was down approx 1. Lifted float/sensor #2 until it was clear of water. Pump started OK and pumped until water level reached top of float/sensor #1---instant cut off.  I am ready for vacation with peace of mind.\nPart 3---went on vacation to Reno, NV in April 2016 and returned 9 days later to find tank in perfect condition. My 25 gallon storage tank was down approximately 10 gallons so the system ran twice with no problems. It is now the middle of June 2016 and still no problems--no problems with salt on the sensors as others have complained about--no problems with stuck sensors---no problems period!

But the next part of my review is the important part, which would have kept me from buying this bed had I known. There are two zippered sections that hold in the fluff...the part where the dog lays down and the upright part of the bed. The inside fluff of the upright part is packaged nicely, easily removed and easily put back in. The part where the dog lays down, that's just loose fluff. So in order to wash this bed, you either have to leave the fluff inside the bed (it wouldn't fit in my stacked washer) or create a mess getting it all out...not to mention the tedious part of putting it all back in. If they had designed the bed where the inside fluff was packaged up nicely in both sections, making it easy to disassemble for washing and reassemble once clean, I would have likely given this 4 stars (5 if the zipper didn't pop off), but instead I'm left with what seems like a nice bed that is completely inconvenient to keep clean.

After a couple of months, it didn't seem very effective at all, and I went to my local fish store to look at new filters.  The guy at the store asked if I was using the circular white \"polishing\" filter pad that came with the Eheim.  I said I was, and he told me that the white pad should only be used if you're the kind of tank-obsessed person who cleans the filter every few days.  Otherwise, because it's so fine, it gets clogged up with gunk fairly quickly and restricts water flow, so that the whole filter becomes less effective after a few days. He suggested removing the white pad and adding a 2nd coarse filter pad. I did that, and the filter has been working really well in the 4 months or so since.  It keeps the water nice, doesn't leak, and is reasonably easy to clean.  I'd give it 5 stars, except that I would have appreciated some better instructions that explained what I just mentioned above.

The different shocking levels are an excellent idea.  Dog originally ignored the beeping and first 3 shock levels.  After taking it to level 4, he got the message and has learned to respect the device since.  We can now leave it on the beep-only setting and he has learned to fear it.\n\nPart of the problem is that the dog has learned to fear the beeps a bit too much.  Once he hears beeps he knows the collar is on and he has not intention of playing in the permitted space (which is really quite large).  Instead, when he knows there is a potential of shock evidenced by the beep, he almost immediately comes to the front door and wants to come in.  He simply isn't comfortable in the big year at all.\n\nAs far as location and setting, don't expect any precision.  We've tried playing with the base location and settings for hours and for the most part you will have 10-30 feet variations in the boundary, and this can change from minute to minute; sometimes it starts to beep 10 feet on one side of the sidewalk, later the device needs to get into the road before it beeps.  Some of this might be batter strength or who-knows-what, but don't expect precision.\n\nBottom line, better than buried-wire devices that dogs quickly learn to ignore or endure short pain for freedom.

My 12 y.o. cat was previously on a  purina one canned diet with small dry food snacks but after researching extensively on basically every brand of cat food available I think I've found \"the one\" for my cats. I also have two new 10 week old kittens who were raised on Solid Gold dry kibble before they came home with me. I tried to slowly introduce them to freeze dried/dehydrated food with Sojos Turkey complete (also freeze dried) to get them off of the dry food (which is known to be less healthy). However only one of the kittens liked it and my older cat wouldn't go near it. I've found that for freeze dried food this is considered a Low/Low-med price for a quality option.  My kittens have liked the transition thus far (to Grace not Prowl). Best of all is the added bonus of extra supplements/minerals/vitamins which means I don't feel it necessary to buy additional expensive cat supplements. I'd rather spoil my cats with this than have them get sick on less than nutritious food and spend the same or more on vet bills. The only reason for not giving it a 5/5 is I would prefer a higher protein and less carb (the non-grain carbs).  It has a comparable (or better) carb to protein ratio than most other freeze dried options.", "summary": "Amazing Company and Amazing Food...", "unixReviewTime": 1451174400}

My baby is turning 12 tomorrow and sometimes she just isn't able to hold it in while we sleep or are at work, so this works amazing.

I can't say enough good things about this cage so I'll just list the pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\nThe plastic is strong, flexible and expertly molded; no sharp edges, no hanging pieces of plastic due to improper molding, uniform color and very smooth. I'm impressed with the quality of the molding. It's not often you see such quality in molded plastic.\n\nThe wire section is stronger (thicker gauge) than most cage wire. It is expertly painted, with no paint runs or drips and there are no sharp ends that will harm your pet. I especially like the way the four wire pieces are held in place.\n\nThe top section that opens and closes is well designed and easy to use. The four locks are simple yet strong and convenient, although I have no need to lock mine.\n\nThe bottom tray section is very deep, which gives my hedgehog plenty of space to burrow and hide. It's also very easy to disconnect from the wire cage and is very easy to clean and disinfect.\n\nInside the partially enclosed balcony is a nice place for any small pet to rest, sleep and hide. The top of the balcony also provides a place to keep the food and water clean yet readily available. Of course, my hedgehog never went into this little man made cave and there's no way for him to get to the top of the balcony.\n\nCONS: The water bottle is absolute garbage. It leaks constantly and the slightest pressure on the bottle will cause the water to come out of the nozzle. A water bottle that functions properly will not release any water from the nozzle when squeezed. I put the water bottle in the trash, which is where it belongs. I use two Choco Nose H128 bottles, one for backup in case one stops working properly. I've found that Choco Nose bottles surpass all the others in quality and functionality.\n\nCONS (Only As It Applies To Me):  You cannot expand the space for your pet by adding another one of these cages. Two of these cages cannot be placed back to back because there are no doors on the back and the door would have to be in the center. Two of these cages cannot be placed end to end because there are no doors in the center of the ends. Two of these cages cannot be placed front to front, flush at the ends, because the door locations will not match. I want to add another one of these and have the cages back to back, so that I can open the tops inward from the front of each cage. Of course, I can do this if I place, during assembly, the side with the doors on the inside between them,reversing one of them so that the doors line up. In this way, my hedgehog will have access to both living areas and I can keep him in one cage while I clean the other cage.\n\nAgain, I realize that this cage is not meant for hedgehogs but it would accommodate them very well if a detachable ramp was available so that they could get onto the top of the balcony to eat and drink, thus keeping their food and water away from any bodily waste. It would also be nice if there was a detachable barrier for the open side of the balcony, leaving an open space at the end to accommodate a ramp. The balcony could be re-engineered to accept an optional ramp and barrier and any slight increase in price would be borne by those who purchased the optional ramp and barrier. I have removed my balcony because the little guy has no interest in using the space below it for any reason but I'm sure that most hedgehogs would find the hiding place under the balcony welcoming and secure.\n\nIn any event, This is a product of exceptional quality and there should be no hesitation when buying it. I would recommend this cage to anyone with a small pet. In my opinion it is under priced, considering what you have to pay for cages of lesser quality and smaller dimensions.", "summary": "OUTSTANDING!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1486339200}

He was in swim therapy after he had knee surgery to help him recover and get stronger but being exposed to water, no matter how clean his home is and his bedding and how natural his food is, he still would get an ear infection or coat yeast infection.  He seemed to pick up the coat issues after walking in areas where the plants were dead and some of the area on the walk path was damp.  He came down with an ear infection from swim therapy but we have been trying to avoid the constant use of antibiotics because of his system and he is an older dog.\n\nI bought this hoping it would help clear up my dog's ear infection.  It did not.  I  used the Zymox Ear Cleanser for a week and it did not do anything.\n\nI eventually found after searching the internet, an all natural solution!  This natural remedy was a great help and has nearly wiped out the problem altogether.  Old fashion vinegar and water!\n\nI made of 1 part vinegar and 2 parts water and used that instead of the bottled product.  I would use the water and vinegar with a cotton ball and gently swab out the brown yeasty paste that was in my dog's ear.  This natural remedy did much better than the Zymox ear cleanser.  After one use, my dog's ears showed sign of improvement using the vinegar and water.\n\nMy friend told me to try the Zymox with the hydrocordizone.  So I bought the Zymox with hydrocordizone 0.5%.  This formula is a thick enzymatic gel and it helped break up the dog's ear yeast infection, especially deep down inside the ear.  But he still itched and wobbled his head a lot because the solution would get stuck down in his ear and not come out.  Poor thing.\n\nI started using the vinegar and water solution again and the gunk began to make its way out of his ears. I would swab them out with a cotton ball using vinegar and water and it immediately did a better job than using the Zymox with hydrocordizone by itself.  So I would alternate, using the gel one day and the vinegar and water the next, allowing the dead material time to come out.  After a few days, his ears looked really clean and he does not show any signs of wobbling, discomfort, or itching.  His ears are pink and clean now, not red and itchy.\n\n I think you are better off using a solution of vinegar and water which I have found, incidently, to be great for coat problems and bacteria or fungal infections.  Just give the dog a bath really good and use a ratio of one part vinegar to 3 parts water, or four parts water depending on the sensitivity of your dog, and let it soak in, and then rinse and condition your dog as usual.  Between baths, I use the vinegar/water solution with cotton balls to swab the infected areas of the coat (if I see a break out) and it clears it up.  It will take a good month of close attention to get rid of yeast, fungal, and bacteria infections on a dog and you have to wash the bedding frequently to make any solid progress.\n\nI would not use this Zymox Ear Cleanser again because it did not seem to do anything at all but I would recommend the Zymox hydrocortizone 0.5% enzyme gel.  I think they make a stronger solution as well.\n\nMostly, the vinegar and water I think makes a great combination to really cleanse and kill the infection at its source.  (Don't poke around in your dog's ear with Q tips unless you know what you are doing and how to gently do it around the edges and not the inside.  Better to use clean fresh cotton balls and don't use cotton balls that have been swabbed in one ear. Don't use the cotton balls on one ear and then on the other or you will risk spreading infection to the other ear!)  If you use vinegar and water for the ears, use separate cotton balls to swab and make sure the cotton balls are at least half saturated and then gently squeezed out before you apply it to the ears.\n\nCaution:  Don't make the vinegar too strong or you'll risk burning your dog's ears and tender ear drums!", "summary": "THIS DID NOT WORK BUT OTHER ZYMOX SOLUTIONS AND VINEGAR AND WATER DID!", "unixReviewTime": 1415145600}

It's a good idea to involve a vet if you suspect your pet might have an infection or other medical complication and not rely solely on these tablets for treatment of some urinary tract conditions.\n\nWith that said, I can assure you that these Vet's Best tablets are most certainly a one-of-a-kind product and I HIGHLY recommend them as a preventative care measure, a first-line of defense when urinary tract symptoms appear and also as a relief agent when your animal is enduring an infection.\n\nI have used this product on both cats AND dogs in various stages of UTI with fantastic results!\n\nThere's not much I can say except that these are my number one choice and go-to remedy when a pet starts exhibiting urinary tract issues.

We read an article about best dog foods and this was on it. Our breeder used Hill Science Diet with the same flavor as this and so we continued that for the first few weeks until I read that article and found that Hills Science was one on the list that they DON'T recommend. The list contained a lot of very expensive foods and this one was one of the cheapest on the list so we thought we'd try.\n\nDifferences: 1. The food pellets are smaller and more rounded. 2. When you add water (because they are puppies), it turns to a gravy. Hills food just expanded like a sponge but did not turn into a gravy. 3. My puppies LOVE it! They practically inhale the food. With Hills, they would just eat the food but it took a while and some times they would not even finish it. With this food, they are excited to eat and they finish every bit and want more. They want to eat all day long now! They are constantly checking the kitchen to see if we've put more food down for them.\n\nWe have two Vizsla puppies from the same litter. One has slightly looser stools and gas (after switching to this) and the other does not. I think that means that, the \"loose stool\" and \"gas\" issues are going to be on an individual dog basis. We have only used the dog food for 4 days.\n\nThe difference in appearance was enough to convince me and I am willing to put up with the issues as long as it doesn't cause them pain or harm.

(If you want a more stylish cover, the Molly Mutt brand makes covers that nicely fit both the medium and large beds.) One nice feature is that inside the fleece cover, the foam itself is covered in another layer of white fabric. This both protects the foam from invading dog hair and debris, and makes it easier to slip off the fleece cover.\n\nThese may seem a little pricey, but if your pup's not a bed destroyer these are absolutely worth it.

While this brush does a good job removing fur, the shallow teeth mean the brush needs to constantly be pruned of fur every 2-3 strokes. Even then, my floor and my person are covered with fur within minutes (my pup gets brushed 1-2 times per week)\n- My pup is medium sized (50 lbs) with a double coat.

To start with I have used Maracyn Two for dropsy in the past and it works GREAT! within only a day I would see a difference and the fish would get 100% better BUT it always comes back later which is the main problem why people say its really hard to cure.\n\nFrom the university's and vet reports Maracyn Two can cause kidney failure. Well thats what we are trying to cure and thats why it comes back and it comes back worse and kills the fish.\n\nNow I read in forums Kanaplex is the best because its not as damaging to the kidneys (not as but still is). I read from university and vet reports that Kanamycin which is Kanaplex may cause renal damage \"kidney failure\" (oh great now what?) No wonder everyone is having relapse with dropsy, Kanaplex kills the bacteria then the fish gets better but then the kidneys start to fail because of the medicine and Dropsy comes back again.\n\nNote: I have been trying Kanaplex in the water and it has done nothing to help my 4\" Black Moor Goldfish with mild dropsy. In fact she was getting worse. I did read the fish only absorbs 15% of Kanaplex in the water and is not as successful in the water for internal infections. It should be given by mouth if the fish is still eating for internal infections so the fish is absorbing the correct dose. After trying it in the food by the next day the scales have went down but I don't have faith she will be cured. I will keep giving her Kanaplex in her food for 10 days and update but After reading and researching I am afraid Kanaplex is just further damaging her kidneys :(... She will die if I don't try anyways so we will see.\n\nQuote from Dr. Govind Pandey:\n\"kanamycin and amikacin are very effective against Gram-negative bacteria when given by injection. However, they cause kidney damage in fish when given by this route.  Kanamycin and neomycin may be effective against external infections if used in bath treatments. Besides, kanamycin is also effective when mixed with feed to treat gastrointestinal bacterial infections. \n\nSo going by the above research from Dr. Govind Pandey... Kanamycin can cause kidney damage and is good for gastrointestinal bacterial infections BUT if the fish already has kidney problems with dropsy FORGET IT! its only going to come back and end up killing the fish with kidney failure. So now what? No wonder everyone says it works but then Dropsy comes back again later and kills the fish. If the fish has only a gastrointestinal bacterial infection and NO kidney problems then this may work ok but not if the fish already has kidney problems (dropsy). so this is why I give Kanaplex 3 stars. Its good for somethings but not the things we are told and believe works. Its basically tricking you into thinking it works but then comes back with vengeance. so sad :(...\n\nNow I know why the experts say its better to euthanize the fish with clove oil because there really is no cure for Dropsy symptoms YET but is there?  How about what they use to treat humans with bacterial, pathogens and kidney problems? or dogs and cats? Lets research that and go from there. Maybe we must think outside the box with feeding the fish a natural remedy that won't cause the kidneys further failure.  Probiotics, enzymes and anti-parasite Herbs are a big break through for treating bacterial and pathogen parasitic Infections how about some of these may work for fish too?\n\nQuote from Drugs dot com:\nKanamycin\n\"This medicine may cause kidney problems, nerve problems, and hearing problems (like long-lasting hearing loss). This could even happen at normal doses. The risk of these problems may be higher if you already have kidney or hearing problems, if you get high doses of kanamycin, or if you get kanamycin for a long time. The risk may also be higher in older people, infants, or people who are dehydrated. Hearing loss can happen even after kanamycin is stopped. If you already have kidney problems or hearing problems, tell your doctor. Your doctor will watch you closely and may run hearing and kidney tests. Talk with your doctor.\nDo not use kanamycin if you are taking or have recently taken any drugs that can cause nerve, kidney, or hearing problems. This may be drugs like amphotericin B, bacitracin, cephaloridine, cisplatin, colistin, cyclosporine, ethacrynic acid, furosemide, paromomycin, polymyxin B, vancomycin, viomycin, or other drugs like this one. There are many other drugs that can do this. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Very bad muscle problems and very bad breathing problems have happened with kanamycin.\n\nSo there you go... make sure you research drugs before giving to fish and know exactly what you are treating for or you could be making the fish worse. The side effects that happen to humans happen to animals and yes fish too. We all have the same organs to live and labs test these meds for side effects on animals and fish before humans. You can be assured what side effects happen to humans also happens to animals and fish too.\n\nMy common sense tells me its the very medicine that is bringing Dropsy back with kidney failure or the micro parasites have biofilm  and nothing will kill them. so now what do we do? What medicine will kill the bacteria and micro pathogens but not further damage the kidneys?\n\nBaytril is what the vets use for fish with Dropsy and that will be my next research. Baytril does not seem to cause further kidney damage. Perhaps Seachem can start selling Baytril medication for fish. Baytril is already being sold over the counter for pet birds so why not make it for ornamental fish too.  FDA does not want Baytril to be used in animals meant for human food because of human antibiotic resistance and thats why its controlled and has warnings not to use on farm animals for human food but it is/can be approved to be use over the counter for pet meds like it already is for pet birds. Baytril is popular for use with small animals and ornamental pet fish. Seachem get busy...  get Baytril approved for over the counter ornamental fish medication.", "summary": "It works TEMPORARY for Dropsy!", "unixReviewTime": 1531094400}

However, because I'm not a big cat person, I think I can offer a critically fair review.\nThe idea of cat poo/pee indoors doesn't sit well with me, so I'm always up for my wife trying something new, which will better absorb odor, and not make a huge mess. We used Tidy Cat for the longest, and it's ok, as far as basic litters go. When our cat was injured, we moved to the recycled newspaper litter, so it wouldn't stick to her fur while she healed; it wasn't bad, but not the greatest to scoop (the plus side was that there was virtually no mess from our cat exiting the box). We then tried Feline Pine (I believe is the name), and that was a disaster. It smelled like pine out of the bag, but began to smell almost immediately. My wife then decided to branch out and try Nature's Miracle JFC Corn Cob cat litter.\nNow, here is a break down of Pros and Cons:\nPros:\n-It has a light, organic smell, pretty much like what you would expect from ground up corn cob; it's not strong and has no perfumes.\n-It clumps fairly well.\n-It absorbs odor equal to any clay or other organic litter we've tried--not better, not worse.\n-There's no dust/residual that would be harmul to breathe.\n\nCons:\n-It can be kind of messy. Because it is ground up cob, the individual grains are very light and can easily go everywhere if disturbed, so be prepared to sweep up often.\n-While it does absorb odor, when the box needs to be changed, it can be quite odorous. Again, it's corn cob, which, when combined with wet waste, gives off an odor that resembles rotting produce. Seriously. Right after we started using it, I went into our utility room, and noticed what smelled like produce that had sat in the garbage too long. I couldn't figure out where the smell was coming from, because the utility room is upstairs, and the odor didn't initially resemble a litter box in need of changing. I looked all over the room, trying to figure out how old veggies would've ended up in there (we do have kids, after all), and happened to be on my hands and knees looking around near the cat box, when it dawned on me what I was actually smelling: urine-saturated corn cob.\n\nAll in all, I can't complain too much about this product, because it doesn't cling to our cat's fur or paws, it has no dust or strong odors, and performs pretty well. Having had a cat in the house for a decade, and having tried tons of different litters, I can say that there is no miracle litter out there. However, this does the trick decently, and again that's coming from someone who doesn't like the concept of litter boxes to begin with.\nHope this helps!", "summary": "Decent Corn Cob Cat Litter, Yes.

It was a last second purchase.  I had already grabbed 3 cat toys I was going to try when I saw this one.  It was $14.00 where I bought it (which was a little more than I wanted to pay) but I purchased it anyway.  I have a few kitties in dire need of a little weight loss.  From the moment I took it out of the package my cats loved it.  I have 6 living in the house and every single one of them love to bat it, chase it, bite it, and sometimes run off with it. When they hear me pressing the button to activate the dragonfly they come running.  I will say that the cord is a little flimsy so if your cats like to chew cords you may want to buy a second one or maybe use a little electrical tape?  I haven't had any other issues with this toy.  I think I have used it so much that the battery may be about to run down, but I think I will just buy a new one.  If you have been searching for a cat toy that your cats won't turn their noses up at, I believe this one is it.  2 paws up!\n\nIf you find my review useful please let me know and if you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them below and I will answer them as quickly as possible.

You can scrub it and it takes a lot of attention to keep it clean, to keep it safe. This is an everyday job, as it should be. I suggest using yesterday's news for litter, two water sources, two food bowls, and three or more hammocks, I also have a tunnel a box or balls and a hanging bird house looking thing made of cloth.
