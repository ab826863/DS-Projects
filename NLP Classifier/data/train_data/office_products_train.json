{"reviewerID": "A2LIOYTH2PF9QO", "asin": "B00006IFJK", "reviewerName": "Ayatsuri Ningyo", "verified": false, "reviewText": "Firstly, people should know that this pen is a marker type pen. Since the whole tip is marker-type, it's hard to guess how this will hold up long term, or if you end up getting bolder lines the more you use it (like a standard marker). I've never had this particular brand and model of pen before, so I can't answer long-term use questions.\n\nI bought these pens because I wanted to write notes on post-it notes and stick them to my computer monitor, and have them be easily readable at a glance. I could've used sharpies, but they stink, and though I own lots of \"inky\" pens, none of them produced a line that was quite thick enough as it's normal width (without going over it twice or more, or writing very slowly to get more ink). I also tried fine tip markers, but they wrote just a tiny bit too thick, so that the letters were harder to read. I bought these hoping to hit the sweet spot between pens and markers, and as it turns out, that's exactly what I got with these.\n\nThis pen produces a line close to what you'd expect of a 1.0 mm pen (something probably around 75-85% of a mm for the actual line). This means you'll get nice, bold lines, but not so bold that it should start to loose readability, like with some fine tip markers. Also, being marker type pens, you don't have to worry about the skipping ink issues and so forth that you have with ordinary pens, which is a must for those who love to write, or do a lot of it.\n\nAs for comfort of use, that will probably depend on the user.\n\nThe pens have a totally smooth plastic body, with no grip, that gets skinnier until it gets to the point. So if you think that a grip-less, totally smooth plastic pen will be a problem for you, you might want to reconsider. Personally, I don't see this being a problem for me, at least... but then I don't plan to write pages with it. If I did, I probably would opt for something with a grip, because I could see this being a problem if you were trying to use it to write pages of text. But for quick notes, it should be fine.\n\nSo far, I'd give these five stars, and unless the tips wear down a lot, I'd probably get these again!

While it's not exactly flimsy, I'd by no means \"heavy duty.\" This is one of those binders wherein the rings are attached not to the center of the folder, but to the back of the back flap. In theory, this should make it easier to turn pages and really get use out of the full inch the ring offers.\n\nThere were a few things that bothered me about this binder right off the bat, though. First, it has clear plastic windows on the front, back, and spine. This would be great except for the fact that the plastic is rather loose. Even the insert with the product information slips around (and out) easily when you just turn the binder upside down. Likewise, the white plastic that covers the cardboard which makes the cover is bubbled. While this is primarily visible on the inside, it makes the binder look rather cheap (there is one particularly large bubble on the front inside cover that annoys me to no end.\n\nDespite the surface flaws, the binder is quite sturdy and has held up well to being carted back and forth and being opened and closed many, many times. The rings, so far, haven't gone askew, and that's probably the most important thing in any binder. At present, Amazon lists this binder at almost twice the cost of a comparable Avery binder.

Revelle", "reviewText": "This calculator is just what I wanted and needed. I have owned top of the line graphing calculators from HP, Casio, Sharp, TI, etc., but overall I like this one almost the best due primarily to its simplicity and ease of use. I like it especially for trips and outside activities when I can do quite useful mathematical explorations that I don't normally have time for at home or in the office with my busy schedule. It was designed by HP and teachers, first and foremost however, as an aid in teaching HIGH SCHOOL students mathematics in a very user-friendly manner.\n\nPROS:\n\n1) It is simple, fairly light and quite fast (75 MHz clock speed), algebraic equation operating system (EOS), but not with HP RPN, but not bad for the money since the hp 39gs units are now on sale for $63.99 compared with $59.99 for the new HP 35s for example which is a great machine, but which is totally outclassed by this much more versatile unit. The hp 39 gs is now about one year in production having replaced the 39G+ with a much better designed keyboard, etc. as described below and has evolved through 3-4 flavors from the original HP 38 of about a decade ago).\n\n2) Very well organized analysis activities using special Aplets with about a dozen available with the unit and many many more on the world wide web (or you can write your own since programming is also available on the 39 gs). These specialized Aplets include analysis of functions, parametric equations, the famous HP solver system, statistics, etc. (with least squares curve fits available for about a dozen types, such as cubic, exponential, power law, logistic or even a user defined type, etc.!). The unit also has about 200 kb of available RAM and about 1 Mb of ROM for the operating system which is a lot more than the more powerful hp 48gII for example.\n\n3) It will supply three types of analysis for every problem, namely a numerical table of values, a graphic plot (only two-dimensional types however) and a symbolic analysis which is only completely possible for the simplest Calculus cases (polynomials and basic trig, logarithmic and hyperbolic functions). Nevertheless, it also does numerical differential and integral Calculus and it can even supply a Taylor series approximation for your functions. It can also display a fine split-screen view (side by side) supplying a table of values as well a plot which is also very useful (with many useful zoom options).\n\n4) It also handles some advanced mathematical functions (including hyperbolics, etc.) and of course can be used to analyze complex numbers, lists and matrices and can even take the square root of negative numbers directly in a very straight forward manner (unlike the HP 35s)!\n\n5) It also allows the user to make detailed notes and sketches and also interfaces very nicely with a PC using the USB cable supplied with the unit for exchanging information. It also has an RS-232 (serial) as well as an infrared transfer option available as well.\n\n6) It comes with a well written and well organized 314 page users manual and with an even more advanced manual available on the supplied CD.\n\n7) It has a new Flash ROM so that the calculator can be electronically updated if new EOS software ROM's are produced by HP without changing out the hardware.\n\n8) Date and time is always available with the on-board clock (using the DISPTIME command)\n\n9) The unit has a totally redesigned keyboard that has quite an excellent feel to it (unlike the fiasco's connected with the HP 49g series for example and even better in my humble opinion than the revered HP 50g now in production for over a year too which I also own). The overall unit seems to be very well made and should last a very long time too. As always, the calculator special self tests are excellent and are triggered by simple keystroke commands. Also, Typing RULES or AMIGOS in \"Home\" produces two \"HP easter eggs\" of people who were involved in the design and production of this great system.\n\n10) It has a completely scrollable operations history in HOME (unlimited within the available RAM memory and also easy to erase when extra memory is needed) that is very easy to manipulate by using the Copy command to recall previously evaluated expressions in order to perform quick \"what-if\" analysis, etc.\n\n11) It is also very intuitive to operate in my opinion even without HP RPN. It is a great start to get students and teachers interested in doing more math and science too which is a very good thing considering recent trends in North America.\n\nCONS\n\n1) The batteries only last 65 hours according to HP. I can't confirm this fact as of yet, but it uses 4 AAA batteries as well as a common Lithium battery to be used as a backup while changing the main batteries.\n\n2) It is quite thick in comparison to other such calculators and in spite of the supplied high quality slide-on cover (a maximum total 1.22 inches thick with the cover on for protection), HP should have supplied a good case for further protection as has been its standard for many other of its calculators (including the HP 35s). Why just imitate the other manufacturers with a slide-on cover for its only protection? HP has always gone its own way in this field considering how few people really understand or actively use RPN logic every day (which I have previously always preferred for many years now). Most of us now have easily accessible computers and compilers to do most computing tasks. I usually use a calculator at work only to carefully check intricate computer calculations, but when I do I want it to be simple and easy to use, especially since I don't use it every day.\n\n3) It will not analyze ordinary differential equations as the more advanced calculators can now readily do. Also, the statistical applet correlation coefficient provided is only for a linear curve fit (regardless of the fit assumed). The relative error is provided instead for both the linear as well as for any of the other curve fit options.\n\n4) Hopefully its sister calculator, the HP 40gs (with a full HP Computer Algebra System-CAS) for UNIVERSITY LEVEL will also be released in North America soon. HP has recently combined efforts (as of early May, 2007) with a company in Oregon to use the 39GS and 40GS for routine laboratory measurements at high schools and at universities in the very near future.", "summary": "One great  algebraic calculator!", "unixReviewTime": 1190332800}

I absolutely love this one. Compared to my previous one that died a noble death after shredding for me for about 10 years, this one is far and away better. (I paid a LOT more for the previous one too.) This one is very quiet. It sounds and feels as if it is having no trouble at all shredding whatever I put into it. To be fair, I never shred more than maybe five layers at a time, just in case but I didn't with the previous one either. I love being able to just pull out the basket to empty it. No having to lift off the heavy top portion as I did with the old one. It is a tiny bit top heavy, but since its basically sits in one spot all the time, it doesn't matter. It was super easy to put the casters on, but it looks as if once they are on, they can't be removed. No matter. I like being able to roll it if I want to.

The printer itself deserves almost 5 stars, I really love it. It has a few drawbacks, but at this price it's perfect for a home or small office machine.\n\nMy 11 year old Brother multi-function finally gave up the ghost, so I'm amazed at how much faster printing, scanning, faxing, and copying are now. I'm especially pleased that this printer doesn't curl the output paper like Brothers printers tend to.\n\nOne reviewer mentioned how the document feed tends to pull the paper a little crooked. This seems to be more of a problem with short stacks of paper, and is most likely the result of there being only one pinch roller in the middle of the paper path. It's less of a problem if the sheet guides are as close as possible, but that makes it more difficult to get the paper into the tray. This might be a non-starter for a small business, but I can live with it.\n\nOne other thing to watch out with the feeder: as usual with low end printers the feeder is a bit finicky about pulling sheets. It may not pull any or, if you push the originals a little much, it may pull multiple sheets.\n\nThis might not be the printer's problem, but scanning to or printing from a USB flash drive seems to be pretty slow. It is easy to use the USB drive, though, and navigating folders is simple. Printing from my PC though the USB input is fast, though.\n\nNo problem setting up the WiFi (for use with other devices).\n\nThe software package works just fine. The printer console is easy to use, but most if not all of that is available from the printer's touchscreen as well. I now have a problem deciding whether to use my Nuance PowerPDF software or the scanner software from HP. Need more time to make that decision.\n\nNow for the big problem. HP's installer is rubbish. I have a fully updated Win8.1 PC, but HP's installer could run the MSI services. It took a chat session with 3 hours of remote desktop control to fix the problem. I didn't pay full attention to the whole process (took care of paperwork, read, drank iced tea, and whatever) but did notice at one point that the tech disabled regserv, which is rather alarming. I ran a full system check when we were done and everything seems fine, but this is ridiculous. Reminds me of the worst of UNIX makes. Don't know how common this problem is, but 3 hours for one printer is a lot of money no matter how little the techs get paid.\n\nPros:\n1) fast at almost everything\n2) paper loads in front and you can see how much paper is left\n3) features work as advertised except for document feeder as noted above\n4) backlit touchscreen easy to read in any light\n\nCons:\n1) The touchscreen is a little bit non-responsive, but then my fingers don't work well with most touchscreens\n2) document feeder misalignment\n3) document feeder can grab multiple sheets\n4) software installation\n5) USB speed", "summary": "Great personal multi-function printer, but SW install flawed", "unixReviewTime": 1438560000}

Watson", "reviewText": "I used the original 3M Precision Mousing Surface with mechanical mice for years. When I converted to optical devices, I found the 3M products did not work very well. In a lot of cases with an optical mouse, no pad or special surface of any kind is actually needed. My desk, however, has a glass top and an optical mouse will not work at all on it. I've been using a leather mouse pad from Ikea for a long time. As it happens, it works very well with an optical mouse. It has only two drawbacks: (1) it's black, making it hard to tell when it's getting gunked up and needs cleaning, and (2) despite being fairly heavy (it's leather covering a metal disc) it has a tendency to very slowly creep toward the back of my desk.\n\nThe 3M Precise Optical Mousing Surface (MP200PS) addresses both of these issues and also seems to allow somewhat more meticulous mouse movement. The mousing surface is very thin and with a textured silver-grey color that will make it easy to tell when it needs cleaning. I actually kind of like the feel of the textured surface on my fingertips.\n\nIt has a repositionable adhesive (like a Post-It note) on the underside. 3M's idea is that this allows you to stick it to the outside of your laptop when not in use; in my case, it guarantees that it will not move at all on my glass desktop. The package says the repostionable adhesive is warranted for one year. This adhesive should also mitigate a problem I sometimes had with the original product: a tendency to start curling slightly at one of the corners after many months of use.\n\nAs I wrote above, my old leather mouse pad was remarkably effective when used with an optical mouse. My perception is that the 3M Precise Optical Mousing Surface (MP200PS) does make my mouse (an Apple Mighty Mouse) somewhat more responsive to my hand movements. Whether this will translate into battery savings remains to be seen. As it happens, I just put a new set of batteries in this mouse a couple of days ago. I generally get 2-3 months of almost daily use out of a pair of lithium AA's. I will try to update this review the next time I change batteries.\n\nIf you want a mousing surface to carry along with your laptop or you need one that will stay put on a glass desktop, the 3M Precise Optical Mousing Surface (MP200PS) is a good choice.", "summary": "Designed for laptops, also useful on the desktop", "unixReviewTime": 1301616000}

Used to smaller footprints, I had to figure out a space for it.  Luckily it's wireless and I could put it anywhere in my house.  Eventually I decided on a location and started unboxing it.\n\nIn the box is all the stuff you need to get started.  Cords, ink cartridges, photo paper (a few sheets), software on CD for both PC and Mac users, a sheet of instructions and a CD tray.\n\nAfter you take off all the tape and remove padding per the instructions, you power it up and let it sit for about 2 minutes while things align.  Then you put in the ink cartridges (of which there are (8); unwrapping, unscrewing the ink cap, and setting them into the print head, which you will have already installed prior to plugging in the printer.\n\nIF your cartridges are not seated properly in the printer, you'll see an orange light on the front of the printer.  I saw the orange light, reseated the cartridges and still had the orange light.  I ended up checking out Canon's online support and found that it could also be an improperly locked bail on the printer head, which locks down the ink cartridges.  It was, and once secured, the orange light went away.\n\nLoading paper per the instructions sheet should be easy, but it was confusing to me.  There are actually two paper intake slots.  One at the very back of the printer, and one a bit forward of that.  The forward one is the slot you want, but it took me way too long to figure that one out!\n\nAfter you have things set with ink, paper and only the white (power) light and the blue (Wifi - if using that option) light, then it's time to add the software and drivers via your PC or Mac.\n\nMine installed in approximately 15 minutes on a Windows 7 64-bit PC with plenty of 'oomph' to do the job.  Printer was recognized and a toolbar (L shaped) at the bottom of my desktop screen appeared.  A launchpad for printing, tweaking and manuals for this device.\n\nI printed two test pages and both were quickly produced on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Canon-Photo-Paper-Glossy-8-5-x-11-Inches-100-Sheets-0775B024/dp/B000EUEWGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Canon Photo Paper Glossy, 8.5 x 11 Inches, 100 Sheets (0775B024)</a>, offering vibrant results from my own digital images.  No tacky residue or smearing of the ink, certainly beautiful results as expected from this professional inkjet.\n\nI also printed from photos taken on my iPad via AirPrint - a fantastic feature - which came out great too!\n\nThe reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars has more to do with my frustration over the set-up and the size/weight of the printer.  I'm not a novice at setting up printers, but the directions on this one while 'simple', would benefit from photos versus diagrams and a bit more information - not requiring the user to go to the Canon site for clarification.\n\nThe weight and size of this beast may be a necessary evil to get awesome results, but those with limited space will need to 'make a hole and make it wide' for this one.\n\nOverall, for printing professional quality prints, brochures, and similar, it's a great choice.  Feature-rich with fine detailed print reproduction from digital images, the Canon PIXMA Pro 100 is as promised.\n\nI recommend it!", "summary": "A few struggles with set-up, results are picture perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1367107200}

Even then, it prints backwards (the postage prints where it says \"return\" and \"recipient\" and the return and recipient prints where it says \"postage\". So you have to pull all four pieces (even the bit that's meant to be thrown away) off the strip and pieces them back together on the packaging. It looks incredibly unprofessional, and you have to do a bit of resizing in Photoshop as well because the only settings Paypal has for Labelwriter 330 and 330 Turbo, whose labels are 7.5\", not 7\" like these.\n\nNormally I'd have given these labels an okay rating, but then I found out that Dymo won't even give out the template for this label, or ANY internet postage labels!

Everything was labeled correctly.  The package was easy to open and we love the Two Day Amazon Prime Delivery.  However, although the Back Board #3 and the bottom shelf illustrated holes in the sides for the screws, they were covered by the black material that surrounds the board.  I was prepared to make some changes myself since I don't like to return items.  After thinking about the problem for awhile, I decided to try to tap the board by using a small drill bit.  I aligned the board prior to drilling through the open hole in the frame.  I got lucky!  The drill bit punctured the black covering on one of the two places I tried.  I finally realized the white plastic screws on the top of the shelf board are in the area where the long screws go through the metal frame and line up at this point.  Once I broke through, I did the remaining seven holes in the same way and used the provided Allen wrench to tighten the screws..\n\nAlthough some reviewers thought the keyboard drawer should have slid out more, the keyboard we have just does just make it okay.  I put the monitor and mouse on the top.  The keyboard is on the slide out tray.  By the way, these screw holes were clearly visible for this part.  Our old, large desktop computer is on the floor next to this compact desk.

I already had a B&W laser printer.  I read the reviews, many negative, but bought anyway, reasoning that complainers always complain but satisfied customers stay silent.\n\nThis is a quality printer at a bargain price.  It does everything I want it to and does it very well.  B&W printing is a little heavy (much heavier than my HP) but looks good.  Color printing is excellent; not as good, of course, as an inkjet photo printer, but good all the same.  Default color is somewhat dark but easily fixed with a quick adjustment of the color histogram in the options settings.  I have printed photos on light card to send to friends - they come out nicely.  The brochures I print (double-sided color) are terrific. Color is a matt finish, not the part-glossy look of many color lasers, and is harder to pick as color laser output.\n\nDuplexing works well - no issues.  Envelope printing is good.  Paper feed is straight - I print on pre-printed certificates and the alignment is perfect (better than my HP).  Initial set-up took 20 minutes and was easy.  Noise level is comparable with other B&W lasers.\n\nNiggles? Hardly any. It's comparatively slow to warm up from standby (but acceptable). Occasionally a single sheet of 80gsm in the multi-purpose try fails to pick up and registers a jam.  Putting half a dozen sheets in prevents this. It's heavy and takes up a fair bit of desk space.\n\nSummary: For home use, small office or a networked business this is an excellent printer.

Amith", "reviewText": "I've been purchasing many printers for nearly two decades and because we do so much printing, we go through a lot of printers and have went through the negatives such as expensive ink, paper getting stuck and no easy way of removing it, getting stuck and ruining the spools or certain attachments breaking off.  And needless to say, I've come to the point where I know what kind of printer to buy and what I'm willing to spend on one.\n\nAnd recently through Amazon Vine I was able to test out the Epson Stylus NX420 Color Ink Jet All-In-One.  For one, Epson has been a wonderful brand when it comes to printers, scanners, etc.  In the two decades of using Epson printers, I've come upon a few that have caused me some gray hairs mainly due to the paper carriage and paper getting stuck.  But I've gone through the motions of testing this printer out and I have to say, for its price at under $70, this is a very good printer for the budget-conscious person.\n\nA.  Installation\n\nInstallation was easy.  After removing the plastic and installing the ink cartridges which was easy, just plug it in to your electrical outlet and because it is a wireless printer, just enter your wi-fi security code and install the software on your computer (test on a Mac and PC) and no problems.  Printing right off the bat. (Note: The printer also comes with a USB plug-in).\n\nB.  Copying\n\nThe first step was copying a few documents and printing it out.  Sure enough, the copy and print using the panel controls was easy and straightforward.  Press copy and how many pages and that's it.\n\nC.  Scanner\n\nThe scanner resolution is 5760x1440 dpi and scanner resolution is 2400 dpi.  I do a lot of scanning especially on my Epson Perfection scanner but this time I tried scanning everything from DVD and Blu-ray to CD inserts and seeing how good the quality is and for the most part, I was impressed and I liked the amount of space given for scanning.  It's not small and also, easy to use.\n\nD.  Printer\n\nThis printer supposedly prints B/W pages at 35 ppm and color at 15 ppm.  I was surprised by how quick it took to print.  No long warmup, it just started printing after a few second of pressing print and I like that.\n\nE.  Paper Carriage\n\nThis is a top loading printing device.  I am now a big proponent for flat-laying printing devices as top-loading printers have caused me nothing but grief in the past.  I will say that I like how Epson has put a plastic guard right on the top and made the stand behind the paper easy to use and not detachable.  I like how the paper holder on the front comes out, is collapsible and easy to put back up again.  There is no fail-safe in the back to pull out the paper if your printer eats up your paper and for me, it's important to have that capability.\n\nAnd like all printers, you get bundled software and for its price at under $70, that's pretty good.\n\nBut as I mentioned the positives, what are the negatives?\n\n- One thing I noticed, especially with my parents is they love the ability to take their flash card from their camera, put it into a slot in the printer and print from that.  This is not the printer that can do that and you usually have to pay around near a $100 for that capability.\n-  Cost of ink.  Truthfully, ink is expensive no matter what printer you buy.  Fortunately, Epson and HP are the most reasonable (sorry Lexmark, you're prices and the amount of ink in those cartridges are not reasonable) and easy to find at stores.  It is true that you can buy each cartridge at around $8.99 but in this case, you have four cartridges (one black, three color). Black goes for $15.99 while color goes around $30+.  This is where HP tends to rival Epson and that's the pricing of the color ink.  But if you don't use your printer for color printing and are mostly focused on black and white printing, then at $15.99, that's usually the average ($13-$18).\n- No rear paper remover if your papers get garbled and stuck.  No easy way to pull it off.  Granted, I have not had that experience with this printer but having had many printers damaged because of bad paper, its useful to have that capability to go from the back and pull it out.  You can't do that with this printer.\n\nJUDGMENT CALL:\n\nCompared to other printers around $39-$69, I have to admit that you get a lot for your money with the Epson Stylus NX420.  Printing is very good, speed is very good, ease of use is very good but there are some other things that people may need (especially the flash card capability or even capability to print on photos via a special carriage) which requires for the user to spend about $40-$50 for the next models up.\n\nBut this printer is for those who don't need all the bells and whistles.  Students that just need a printer that can scan, copy and print especially if you are just using it for black and white printing and occasional color and need that wi-fi capability.  So, for its price and how it performed during my tests, it's a very good all-in-one printer for its price point.

We have the Pro 24\" and the 12\" models.  We have owned the 24\" model for about 10 years and it still cuts like new. These paper trimmers, can shave off the thinness slivers of paper, it cuts very precisely.  These trimmers are rock solid, and cut very square.  We have never had to replace a blade, but we do not do a heavy volume of paper cutting.  If you take care of these trimmers they will last a long time.\nI had used RotaTrim paper trimmers for photographs in college, and was impressed, so when we needed a quality paper trimmer, these were my first choice.  They are pricey, but worth the money. (I had tried an inexpensive trimmer which had never cut really square, and did not last long)\nMy one little gripe is with the stick on rubber feet that RotaTrim uses on the bottom, we had one of the feet come off (granted it took years for it to come off)  I recently replaced all the the stick on rubber feet with screw on rubber feet, they seem much better. See Amazon link for the rubber feet I used: (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079Z7Z73Z/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)  I attached the feet using #6 - 1/2\" screws.

Even our high school junior simply prints out his essays/assignments on the school printers when needed.\n\nThe setup is very easy.  The electrical cord has no no AC/DC converter box on it anymore, which is nice.  You just plug it in and set up the wireless connection with your wifi.  You can connect wire connect but will need to have your own cable since one is not provided.\n\nI found that it prints much faster than my 7410 or even the HP officejet pro 6830, which is the larger version of this 3830.\nIn lieu of a paper tray, this printer has slot that you insert the paper at the back of the printer.  You can see the paper sticking up in the back so you know when you are low on paper.\nHere are its dimensions:\n16 inches wide by 10 inches deep by 8 inches high.\n\nIt comes with a software installation CD but it is much easier to just get it online at http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers.  You can also use the touch screen on the printer to check for printer updates by going to the Setup screen.\n\nThis printer only uses 2 print cartridges: one black and one for color, instead of the typical 4 cartridges (1 black, 3 color).\n\nTo summarize, this is a great printer for light duty home and/or home office or even for a HS or college student.

My favorite thing about this phone is the speaker volume on the handset - I can hear even faint callers speaking. The phone is lightweight, so after the initial surprise at how light it is, I found no problems with it- it is solidly built.  It comes with an instruction book, but if you're familiar with digital handsets, you'll already know much of it. It's easy to add to the phone book, and the menu is logical for the most part.  The answering machine's sound replay quality is good and it's easy to select delete, save, skip, etc., from either the base unit or the handsets.  The range seems pretty good - I can take it outside front and back yards and still hear everything clearly.\n\nWhat I really don't like is how it rings. The base unit will ring first, and then as it begins a second ring, one hand unit starts to ring. The second unit doesn't ring until the base is on its third ring! I haven't found any sort of way to adjust this delay. It may be related to the distance from the base, I don't know. Also, the ring on the hand units is not all that loud at max volume.\n\nOverall, I rate it a 4, mainly because of the weird ringing behavior. Otherwise, I like the phone and it's as good as the Panasonic that it's replacing - for a lot less cost.\n\nUpdate: I've gotten used to the weird ringing and it doesn't bother me any more. One thing I missed - you can't use the base unit as a speakerphone, it is strictly for charging and recording/listening to messages. However the handsets' speaker phone sound is quite good.\n\nUPDATE; Over the past six months the handsets became erratic, sometimes holding a charge for a while, other times dying after only a few minutes even though they were fully charged.  I gave up on them and ordered a new phone set by Panasonic. I've had good luck with them as well as AT&T phones which lasted many years.  Two years is not acceptable as far as I am concerned.", "summary": "Good sound, overall nice phone- Update: died in 2 years", "unixReviewTime": 1345075200}

It is important to note that this is an issue with all printers and all ink.  The name brand is always better than a recycled cartridge as well.  I feel very lucky for my printer requires merely a cartridge for black, color and one for photo printing if need be.  I only use the black and color and find with the black ink the estimated 220 page yield is pretty accurate.  I don't do major project priniting like graphics or anything.\n\nMany of my friends have printers that require black and a cartridge for each individual color for a total of about 6 cartridges before it will even print.  How much more expensive that would be.  And they have the same problem with how long the ink lasts.  I tried recycled cartridges for awhile for they are a little cheaper but they would always clog after a while and I would then have to use the clean process thru the printer which uses much ink.  I got at least a 30% lesser page yield with these recycled ones and also had the added frustration.  To get full deep clarity of color in the printing was rare.  But when I use the name brand HP I never have the cartridges clog, the printings are always full with no fading and I can check the ink level on my computer.  I just accept the page yield I get from them, purchase them at Amazon where I get great prices and I can always rely on great printing.  Again sadly, the page yield is a problem with all brand printers.  And the price I paid here for the 2 black cartridges was unbelievable.  I understand the frustration but say this is the best quality and longest yielding ink you will get for an HP printer.

It is what it says it is, though, and it doesn't have the problems of many competitors I read the reviews of.  Namely, that they smell like burning rubber when turned on and they don't have an on/off switch.  This one has no strange smells coming out of it and not only is there an on/off switch on the front but it turns off automatically after 8 hours, which is perfect.\n\nI got it mainly for the office, which is never warm enough (and is actually worse in the summer, when the building blasts AC) and I didn't think they'd approve of a 300+ watt space heater, which, aside from burning electricity, tends to raise fears of burning the building down.\n\nI like the textured surface and the way the footrest angles.  The ability to warm the tops of your feat by putting them underneath seems a bit of a stretch though because it's just a pad that radiates heat -- you aren't getting much heat without putting your feet on top of it.\n\nSo, my guess is you'll probably wish it was warmer, but there's no apparent drawbacks to it.

I LOVED them! They were uni-Blazers by EF and, unfortunately, they aren't made any more (not that I can find anyway). I bought them in 1994 and still use them now in 2010! The ink never dried out. Admittedly, I didn't use them consistently all those years, but I did use them quite a bit when I did. The point is--just because it's a liquid highlighter doesn't mean it has to dry out or run out quickly! ... unlike these Sharpie Accents. I bought this pack because I really liked the other liquid ones and thought these looked nice. Unfortunately, I've been using the yellow one for only two weeks and the ink is half gone!! I thought perhaps the other reviewers were leaving the caps off while they read, but no, I faithfully put the cap back on immediately each time.\n\nThe other thing I really, really dislike about these is that when I use an index card to keep my underlining straight and then move the index card down a line it smears the ink! No other highlighters I've ever used have done this. This doesn't dry as fast as others do. It seems these put too much ink on the page, even thought they don't bleed through much--they do a little. I tried the other colors and they all behaved the same way.\n\nAlso, the cap is really hard to get on and off. There is a little plastic area in the cap that uses a spring to create a seal on the top of the marker. I'm guessing it's to keep it from drying out. But it makes it hard to get on and off, which makes it quite annoying to put the cap back on every time you use it.\n\nThese highlighters are very bright. You probably won't overlook a highlighted portion of text on a page. Sometimes, I feel it is too bright, but that's just a personal preference. If you like a very bright marker and don't mind it running out really quickly, these might be ok for you. They do look nice and don't feel too bad in the hand--I'm pretty picky that way.\n\nSo, I'm going to try another brand and give these to my daughter to play with till they finish running out.", "summary": "Run out to quickly", "unixReviewTime": 1288051200}

I purchased this printer six months ago, and have been disappointed with its performance and features. I use this printer in my home office, and find that it is a bit noisy.  If I want to print something I make sure I'm not on the phone, or in a meeting. Print jobs often get \"stuck\" and will not process until you restart the printer- a time consuming event.  In addition, the paper feed often gets jammed.  The envelope printing feature is a disaster.  The envelopes usually get stuck, or they will print with ink smudges.  I also found their scanning feature lacking.  If you scan a document, it will scan a regular sized paper into a huge file.

Twice the installer hung forever and required a system restart in Mac OS X (current version), and I finally ignored the CD and installed through CUPS (localhost:631).  This was annoying enough, but it also selectively fails to print, with no indication that anything is wrong other than a job forever stuck in \"waiting to complete\" state.  I have two other printers that work fine, so this is not a newbie issue, although it does entail the somewhat greater complexity of a printer-sharing setup and may be more reliable on a direct USB connection to the host machine.\n\nWhen it works, it does so smoothly and quickly, and the envelope handling (from Endicia) is noticeably better than my trusty Epson.  I have not tried the photo-quality printing for which this unit is famous, so this is not a comprehensive review... just a comment on the Mac integration.  I'm fairly loyal to Canon as I love their cameras, but the bloatware that ships with this printer is both inscrutable and fragile in the OSX environment.\n\nUPDATE 1:  Since my initial writing of this review, it has died completely:  it is convinced that the cyan ink tank is not recognized, even though it is FULL.  This prevents any operation of the printer, and cannot be bypassed with re-inserting the cartridge, resetting, power cycling, or anything else.\n\nUPDATE 2 (about 2 weeks later):  I have to credit Canon's tech support for responding well... they quickly shipped a replacement Cyan ink tank, which fixed the problem.  Stopping and restarting the printer in CUPS released the hung jobs, and it is now working quickly and smoothly.\n\nUPDATE 3:  (a few months later) OK, final word on this.  I hate it.  When it works, it is fast and produces beautiful output.  But it's flaky, and even running out of paper is a traumatic experience that requires power-cycling, fiddling, stopping and starting the printer in CUPS, and various incantations (not all polite).  I would absolutely not get another of these, even free.", "summary": "Fragile", "unixReviewTime": 1173830400}

Looking at the cap colors in the picture, I thought these would be perfect. However, only 3 of the pens (orange, pink and green) are actually a light hue. I did not receive the turquoise pen shown, but rather a delft blue, not a pastel blue. The light lavender color pen actually has ink about the shade of a purple African Violet. I also got a medium to dark gray pen, again not a pastel color. I took away a star because of what I feel is a misrepresentation of the colors included with this set.\n\nIt escapes me as to why Staedtler does not label their pens with a color name, or at the least a number, so that if you want to order additional sets you can determine if the colors are duplicates of what you already have. It seems like a simple thing to do. Also, most of the cap colors are not a good match AT ALL with the color of the ink that will flow from the pen. This means that you absolutely must make yourself a sample color chart and label the pens yourself so you can consistently choose the correct pen for the color you want.\n\nI have 3 sets of the Staedtler Triplus fineliners, (set of 20, the pastel set and the Nature set) and these comments apply to all of them.

It does not have the converter/cleaner as described and shown. Instead it has a large, cheap plastic eye dropper thing that is only good for cleaning, if that. Picture attached of what I got. Not at all what's shown in the product photo - at least at the time of this writing.\n\nAll in all, I'm happy with the pen. I'll probably get a regular converter for it anyway, and probably wouldn't have used the nicer plastic case.

The only problem in the past (for me)has been in ink supplies, and the cost per page of photo prints.\n\nPrevious Epson printers were priced lower than this one.  Epsom could do that because they profited from expensive ink cartridge sales.  But this printer comes with two years of ink supplies - expensive cartridges not needed.  (note that  the ink supplied, with the printer, is equivalent to 20 cartridges, or 5 complete sets.)  Just  squirt ink into the reservoir containers.  Epson gets their rightful profits up front, and also makes printing more affordable  .In fact, when initial supplies are used up, users can use any brand of inks of the same quality.  And sticking with Epson inks should also be very affordable.  Users will have a choice.\n\nYou should also know that Epson has built-in this feature into a whole line of new printers.  While this one is probably ideal for most consumer users, you may have special needs and prefer one of the others.  .\n\nI think this is the fastest printer I've ever owned, and the image quality is the best. The only problem that I have found so far is that the printer won't t print edge to edge on 4\"X6\" photo paper, and these unwanted boarders are not the same on all sides.  Epson will probably fix this when they update the app, but I don't know this for sure.", "summary": "ONE PROBLEM SOLVED", "unixReviewTime": 1442707200}

It does not skip(yet) BUT IT DOES FADE AND LINE GETS THINNER. You can visibly see from prior page full of words that the ink is fainter and line is thinner and keeps getting more so as you keep going. It would be a decent conclusion that the last bit of ink is not viable unless you are ok with this fade out. 29 full pages(front and back= 2 pages) of a 8.5x11 inch narrow rulled lined notebook with high density of words BEFORE the fade out became apparent and unsatisfactory.

I am a bit of a pen-o-file meaning I like pens all kinds but have decerning tastes in what I am looking for.\nThis pen is not girlie or pretty but is not ugly either...it has click button depress to extend writting tip. It has a roller ball. It is fine tipped but not scratchy when writting. It has virtually no drag on note paper and is pretty smudge proof( wrote and colored in a circle let dry 10 minutes then wet finger four times over both, paper was wet but ink remained as laid down no change/smudge/or running) wish came in blue have not seen this but personal preference.\nThe case has a pocket/page clip and a rubber like grip (alergic to latex but no problems). It is very comfortable to hold. I like heavier pens but this is far and away lite in weight BUT I still love it since it is so balanced it is close to effortless to write with, so well made it writes smoothly with litte to no preasure. It just glides on and keeps on going. If I take care not to lean my wrist on what I am writing on, I can write longer than any other pen before my carpal tunnel gets annoyed. AMAZINGLY long time and my case was surgery recommended(but success rate was to much of risk so go with brace/ immobilization therapy) Is it Smooth as butter? No in essence but it is smooth as in no paper drag no scratch proper balance smooth if you know the difference I am trying to explain. Oh and I usually like a .07 width but this is .05 or less(does not say) and I still LOVE IT!  I know I cant explain more why that is it just is!

Removing the cartridges to refill eventually causes cartridge failure as there is a counter in the printer program that eventually blocks the cartridge continued use. By filling as follows, the program never \"knows\" the cartridge is being reused: There is a hole on the top of each cartridge. Buy a syringe and needle. Draw ink into the syringe and insert the needle through the top hole WHILE THE CARTRIDGES CONTINUES TO BE IN PLACE. DO NOT PRESS ON OR DISTURB THE CARTRIDGES just easily and delicately find the hole (a little more than midway up the cartridge top, keep gently probing with the sharp syringe needle until you hit the hole through the vinyl sticker over it) and insert the needle. Slowly add ink into cartridge. It helps if you slowly move the needle up and down as it is in a sponge inside the cartridge, and you want to soak as much of the ink holding sponge as possible. When full, if you are pressing the syringe slowly, a little ink will bubble out the top by the needle. Remove the needle/syringe, dab the ink up with a paper towel and GENTLY apply a piece of Scotch tape over the hole. You can use the same syringe for each color, but you must rinse it under running water until it is clear before drawing the next color into it.

I've had a Panasonic phone with 4 handsets, and a clumsy ugly uncomfortable GE phone with 2 handsets. Both were seriously damaged by the dog, so it was time for an upgrade. Replacement Panasonic handsets are $70, and besides, I wanted more than 4 handsets which was more than Panasonic model supported. So, I went with this Uniden model.\n\nFirst, the good. The phones are comfortable to hold, very good voice quality, and long range. My adapter is in the garage, and I have no problems on the second floor.\n\nSomebody complained about inability to add 1 for redial or storing from Caller-ID. But, as was explained here, pressing * adds 1 in front of the number. Weird, but it works. One time, I tried to add an international number (that came across on Caller ID, but without any 011 prefix) - and I couldn't. But at least, it adds `1'\n\nOne unique benefit if you have two sets. You can set *all* 6 handsets to *both* bases and easily switch between them. So, in the end you get a two-line phone system.\n\nOther good things (but no better than old Panasonic): ability to copy address book, comfortable keypad, bright LCD screen, blinking VM light from answering machine or service provider.\n\nNow the annoying part. Most of those have been described by others. One that I will miss from Panasonic - CallerID voice feature. The phone was \"reading\" out loud Caller ID name between the rings, so I knew when to ignore kids' friends' calls without getting off the couch.\n\nUPDATE: One more annoying feature. When I am using Intercom feature - the *calling* handset rings as well. What were people thinking?! I am trying to locate a missing handset that is making faint noise from under the bed - and the ringing in my hand is louder than a rooster!\n\nMatching the incoming call with the directory (ala cell phone), bluetooth, computer integration (for address book, CallerID, and additional ringtones).", "summary": "Almost perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1205798400}

I've used all the built-in features, especially the Calendar with its reminder feature.  Using Word was my second-most used program.  I also bought other software such as a dictionary.\n\nA battery charge on the new iPAQ 111 doesn't last nearly as long and it takes a lot longer to recharge the battery.\n\nIt doesn't have infrared communication ability and one of the great features of my old iPAQ was its spectacular \"universal remote\" capability.\n\nThe volume isn't nearly as loud on the new iPAQ.  Putting it on its highest setting is about the same as medium on the old unit.\n\nThe new iPAQ's screen is much brighter than the old one.  Nice for being in the sunlight, but it uses up the battery much faster.  I set it to a dim setting because I'm usually indoors.  When I'm outside, it takes too many screen taps to access the brightness settings, which is nearly impossible when I'm in the sun and can't see the screen, so I still have to find shade (my hand isn't enough.)  They should've made one-button access to the brightness control.\n\nThe buttons on the bottom of the unit are larger, but they don't have solid space around them like my old one did.  Thus I frequently hit them with my hand while I'm writing on the screen, throwing me into some other function and losing the words I'd just written on the screen.\n\nI am happy the new iPAQ has a commonly available USB cable.  I like that the SD slot and power button are no longer on the top.  Dirt could easily get into my first iPAQ and one of the things that gave me trouble with it was an erratic power button.  Unless you frequently remove the SD card, I suggest you put tape over it to keep dust and water out.\n The new iPAQ apparently has a feature to allow it to connect via Bluetooth to my cell phone so that I can access the Internet when I'm not in a hotspot.  I'll like this, but I haven't tried it yet, so I can't comment further on that.\n The new iPAQ is about half the size of my old one, with the same RAM, memory and screen resolution.  The old one also had a camera, but my cell phone had a better camera, so it wasn't really worth the extra $200 (but it was a lot easier to transfer photos and videos to my desktop.)\n-------------------------------------\nI'm having terrible trouble getting my new iPAQ to sync with my desktop, via ActiveSync.  It takes 45 minutes to synchronize whereas my old iPAQ would easily sync in five.  Then when the iPAQ is attached via the USB cable, the desktop extremely slows down with ALL software.  AND it stays that way even after I disconnect the iPAQ--I have to reboot the desktop.  Thus, I recharge the battery with the separate charger instead of the USB cable--resulting in backing up my iPAQ data less often.  I can put the iPAQ's SD card into my computer to back that data manually, but... I put an 8 Gb SD card into this new iPAQ, but it seems my hp m7070n desktop can't read SD cards larger than 2Gb--but that might be a problem with my Windows XP.\n-------------------------------------\nMy second iPAQ has the newer Windows Mobile 6.0 version, and as so often with \"latest and greatest\" from Microsoft, it's primarily different for the sake of different--I have to learn how the heck to find things that aren't any better than the previous version.  Many of the changes are for the worse.  For example, when Calendar gives a reminder, I have very few \"Snooze\" options.  I'd GREATLY hoped the handwriting recognition would've improved in five years, but it didn't.\n I feel many of the \"improvements\" on Windows Mobile 6.0 was an attempt to compete with iPods and other music devices, and it still isn't as good as them.\n-------------------------------------\nI bought an hp foldable keyboard to go with my new iPAQ 111.  I bought it directly from hp and they told me they no longer had the tri-fold model that had been available.  (I didn't buy that tri-fold when it was available, but wish I had.  LATER, I discovered some retailers still have that smaller model.)  The new keyboard is Bluetooth only and with the way my new iPAQ eats up battery charges, and Bluetooth needs power, I have to keep the unit plugged in.  The older keyboard allows the user to run via a cable.  The new keyboard has a slide-out stand to hold the iPAQ, but it's so flimsy I'm sure it'll soon break.  Plus, the bottom of this stand is rounded and my iPAQ slips off--they should've given it a lip to actually hold the iPAQ.  The keyboard also has something to lock it in open position so we can lay it on our lap without it collapsing down between our legs.  Again, this is so flimsy that it bends and folds anyway.\n-------------------------------------\nI had a metal case from RhinoSkin for my PREVIOUS hp RX3715 iPAQ, but they don't have one for the model 111, so I got one from BoxWave and I'm NOT happy with it.  First, it has a clear plastic face that provides limited protection.  I'd accidentally stepped on my old RhinoSkin case, dented the face slightly, but it saved my iPAQ.  The BoxWave case wouldn't stand up to that.  Second, the clear face lets me read the screen, but I have to open the case to do any screen-touch anyway, so it's impractical.  Third, I don't like letting other people read what's popped up on my screen when I get a Calendar reminder when the iPAQ is on my belt.\n  The new case makes it difficult to reach the power button when the front cover is closed and impossible when the cover is open.  It also has useless access holes in the faceplate.

No need to boot the computer, dials off the contact list, etc.\n\nBut the phone is a bit dated now.  If I were using this as a main line instead of a supplement to my cell phone, I'd find an easier to use arrangement like maybe one of the newer phones or one of the adapters that allows regular phones to be plugged in it.\n\nThe physical cord connections on the Belkin are poorly thought out.  For example there are keyhole mounting slots so it can be wall mounted, but all the cords stick out the back of the phone, making that physically impossible.  Even the power cord which has a 90 degree bend is above the level of the mounts.\n\nThey give a very tall plastic attachment for desk use which eliminates any cord issues, but could easily have put any connections on the sides and made it wall mountable as well.\n\nThe software is not capable of many newer Skype features.  Contacts with more than one number only dial one of the numbers.  There's no way to select among the numbers.  You have to do the old Skype way of having a separate entry for cell, home, work, etc. for each contact.  And while Skype on the computer knows which country you're in, you have to add the + in front of manually dialed numbers.  So I keep falling into the 00 trap where I don't wait long enough and end up with 18+ instead of 1800.  A separate + key would have been great, or even if the # key was used for the plus, it would have been so much easier.\n\nSince these features have been in Skype for a while and there's no update for this phone, it may not be possible with the hardware.  As of November 2009, Skype for the Belkin is version 1.0.1.3, dated Aug 1, 2008.\n\nOther than the clunky usage, call quality is pretty good, although much better on the handset than the speakerphone.  I wouldn't use the speakerphone for an important call.  Overall, if you're more likely to receive calls than to call out or use this just a little, it's pretty good.  For more frequent usage, it might be worth looking for more expensive options.\n\n2010 Update:  There has not been a software update in 2 years, so looks like there never will be.  One big problem is as of last Summer, the adapter that plugs into the outlet started emitting a very high pitched constant noise.  Not sure how to describe it, but it would be a hum if it were lower frequency.  It is barely audible, but extremely annoying and not really worth buying a new adapter.  Definitely recommend looking for some of the newer Skype phones now.", "summary": "Feels a litte dated now", "unixReviewTime": 1257292800}

The ones I like most have silver-colored tops and colored bodies, and you push on a button at the top to extrude the writing part, so you never lose a cap. Their only drawback is their price and the cost of refills, which I can't always find easily in stores, either.\n\nI was so happy with those two types of pen that I never thought of trying to find a substitute, but recently a polymer clay group I belong to had a swap involving decoratively covering pens, and Bic Round Stics were recommended as being able to withstand the temperatures (generally around 275F) involved in baking (and thus plasticizing) the polymer clay. To my great surprise, these pens write beautifully (no matter what color their barrels--though [WARNING] the \"crystal\"-barreled type is absolutely no good for baking)!\n\nVoila! Gorgeous pens that write beautifully, and can be refilled really cheaply. It is true that when I cannibalize a Bic Round Stic pen to use its ink shaft as a refill in a polymer-covered pen, I use the ink from the inside, but discard and thus \"waste\" the pen that contained it; but even so, the price of these pens is so low that the \"refills\" are still incredibly cheap compared to the P'kr and PMt ones! (The only drawback to these \"polymer-covered-pen swap\" Bic Round Stic pens is that the clay layer makes them a bit too thick to take the original caps. No problem! When I take some covered pens with me in my bag, I simply stick them in a leather pen case thick enough to keep the points from piercing it.\n\nFor those who aren't familiar with it, polymer clay comes in many colors, which can be kneaded and blended to make more colors. It contains a plasticizer that turns it into a hard substance when baked for about 1/2 hour (usually in a toaster oven not used for food).  It makes a great hobby. There are some helpful and fun sites where people discuss its use and enjoy swaps. [...] and [...] The pen swap was at City-o-clay, and you may be able to find a link to pictures of the pens in the swap there. Have a look and get some of these great Bic Round Stic Ball Pens (with blue, silver, white, or translucent barrels--NOT the crystal ones) and make some gorgeous pens for yourself and friends.)\n\nOr, if you don't insist on designer colors and patterns in your pens and are content with plain blue and the like, buy a bunch of these Bic pens anyway and use them as is.

Martin", "reviewText": "When compared to other printers, the 860 fares very well in some respects. It produces photo prints that are closest to those that you would get from store processing. It also does quite a good job with text. It merits its \"best buy\" status.\nBut is any printer really a \"best buy\" for photo printing when compared to photo processing? To get store-quality prints with the 860 you need Canon's best paper. And when you use that paper the prints cost far more than store processed prints, but you get nothing more for your expense than immediacy. So, if you need an instant print perhaps it is worth the extra, but the additional cost of printing from the 860 versus taking your memory card to the local store could be immense if you take a lot of photos.\nIn a couple of important respects the 860 prints you get even with Canon Photo Paper Pro are inferior to processed pics. If you bend the Pro paper you will not just get a crease in the paper, you will also get a pronounced line in the photo itself, and it doesn't take much of a bend to cause this. It is also very easy to scratch the surface of the prints. So, they are much more easily damaged than conventional photos. Also, the independent company that does the testing for print longevity has found that the Canon prints will only last about 25 years, while those of HP and Epson will last more than 75 years. Many people want pictures they can save for their grandchildren (or \"posterity\"), and the Canon prints apparently won't meet that desire.\nCanon supples software that you need to utilize all print features. This consumes more time and reduces efficiency. (At least on a Mac.) Even using the printer tray, the pictures are not properly centered if you choose to have borders. There is more white space on some sides than others, so I consider that option useless.\nMost people rate this printer compared to other printers. I prefer to compare it to other real-world options. In that respect it only does so-so. I prefer not to pay considerably more for prints that are no better than I can get by waiting for 60 minutes at a store, or sending them via the internet and picking them up at my leisure.", "summary": "Compared to what?", "unixReviewTime": 1082505600}

Better still, Skrip works fine in my Sheaffer cartridge style fountain pens, but also some of the later production Esterbrook fountain pens.  And more importantly Skrip is available in a far wider variety of colors than other cartridge-style pens (and their own bottled ink!) including turquoise, purple, orange, green, and brown.  This gives writers a broader palate to express themselves, something to think about if you like writing with a little flair!

Nice bonus, since the calculator sits perfectly in the pocket. The binder measures 12.7 inches tall, 11 inches wide, and 1.5 inches thick. It measures 22.5 inches wide when open. The binder inside is a 1 inch. The interior of the front side is lined with a pocket to stick folders that opens up about 2 inches. The outside of this pocket has 6 cardholders, 1 business card holder, 1 mesh pocket w/ velcro, and 1 calculator slot. The picture would indicate that there is a mesh business card holder, fabric pen holder, and another pocket with a zipper, but in fact, there are not. There is however, an elastic pen holder on the inside of the back cover (see picture). The back of this binder is bound with a smooth, matte plastic material, and the rest of the fabric feels like a rough nylon.\n\nAs far as the false picture goes, at the time that I am writing this review, there are separate Amazon listings under different sellers that use this picture, so for all I know, the picture may be accurate for those other binders. For the one I received, it was not accurate. I bought my binder from Bison Office supply.\n\nI like this binder for a few reasons. Firstly, the zipper. It keeps everything in, so if you have an oops!-moment, you won't be embarrassed and have to scramble to pick up all your stuff. It also keeps paper edges from getting damaged and looking shabby. The zipper itself has a nice curve where you hold it that makes it easier to grip, and therefore, easier to zip. There is only one zipper on this binder, and it would be a nice extra if there were two. The zipper has a hole, so you could attach a key chain if you wanted to.\n\nThe second feature I like about this binder is its slimness. It does measure about 1.5 inches rather than 1, but the binders advertised as 1.5 inches usually end up being 2. I hate unnecessarily bulky things, and at my college, we get those chairs with dinky little desk things attached, so small is a must. Furthermore, I only have the rest of my semester's notes in this at any one time. I don't need a 2 or 3 inch binder for that; the 1 inch is great for exactly that amount of notes. I also like the fact that I can keep my wireless notebook and planner inside of this. There's enough pockets for all of the things I need in a class, and I am tempted to just carry this around instead of a bag. I might even try that out.\n\nThe seams on this are tight and durable. When I first received it, I realized that there was a place to put the cardboard backing of a legal pad (to hold it in place inside the binder), but not a place to put the cardboard backing of a notebook, which is what I needed this for. The main difference between these two pockets is that the insert pocket for pads is horizontal and the pocket for notebooks is vertical (see pictures). I really wish that they had included a vertical pocket behind the horizontal one, so both pads and notebooks could be secured inside. It's kind of stupid that Mead doesn't just make a pocket for it. I used my pocketknife to rip out the seam to the side of the legal pad pocket, and now my wireless notebook can be secured just as it could have if it had come made with a pocket for it (see pictures). While I was ripping, I did come across an adhesive around the seam to further secure it. This just goes as further proof to how durable the seams on this binder are. As I slid the back of my notebook in, I came across some more nasty adhesive. To remedy this, I cut the backing of my notebook down to size.\n\nOn a side note that is related, I'm notorious at school for having the most tidy (and most borrowed) notes around. I'm often asked for tips. Since this binder is a key part of my note-taking system, I thought I would share:\n\nI prefer to have extra paper under whatever I'm writing on. I find it very hard to write on one piece of paper with a hard desk underneath. It doesn't give the right amount of cushion to write neatly. Plus, if I'm writing on my home desk, I don't want to scratch or put writing indents on the surface of it. I remedy this situation with a loose-leaf pad (commonly dubbed \"wireless notebook\" on Amazon...&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Norcom-3-Subject-Wireless-Notebook-Wide-Ruled-10-5-x-8-Inches-5-Assorted-Colors-132-Sheets-1-Notebook-per-Order-Color-May-Vary-76132-24/dp/B004YZ7QN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Norcom 3-Subject Wireless Notebook Wide Ruled, 10.5 x 8 Inches, 5 Assorted Colors, 132 Sheets, 1 Notebook per Order, Color May Vary (76132-24)</a>). I have tried marble notebooks and I have tried spiral notebooks. Marble notebooks don't have large enough pages, and they aren't able to tear out without ruining the binding. Not to mention, you can't keep the pages in a binder or in any kind of an organized fashion after you rip them out. Spiral notebooks, on the other hand, have sharp wires that tangle with other spiral notebooks, annoyingly perforated pages that never rip where the perforation is, and leave behind tiny bits of paper that go everywhere. The solution, my friends, is a loose-leaf pad. There's a nice little place in the back of this binder where the pad will fit. I remove the pad from the binder when I have to take notes, since binders are too big for my workspace.

We have two major problems: (1) Getting a conversation started and in sync with the caller, (2) audio breaking up.\n\n#1 is a problem about half the time. We answer a call but there seems to be no one on the other end. Then, after 3-4 \"hellos\", we begin to hear bits of a voice and after a couple more tries we seem to get in sync with the caller and can begin a normal conversation. But sometimes the caller hangs up before that can occur, because they can't hear us either.\n\n#2 is even more serious. After a few minutes of conversation, the caller begins to complain that they cannot understand our words. It is \"breaking up\", like a bad cell phone connection. To the point where it is impossible to continue, so we have to hang up and call back again. That restores service for a few minutes, but the problem recurs.\n\nI don't think it is a problem with our internet or phones - we had Vonage Voip before this and it worked great. And we have good high speed cable internet. We thought to save money using MagicJack, but for us it has been unusable. We have cancelled the service and transferring our number to the Voip phone service from our cable provider.  Somewhat more expensive, but hopefully more reliable. We would have gone back to Vonage, but we got a nice price break on a bundled cable/internet/phone package from Brighthouse.\n\nIn fairness, my sister-in-law uses MagicJack and it works fine for them (they are in a different area, though).", "summary": "Have serious problems", "unixReviewTime": 1447804800}

I would be cautious to casually toss this into a school bag or other heavily used bag without care being taken to avoid it being crushed or pressed against something that could damage the screen.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Soft interior won't scratch the screen.\n- Zipper only goes about 1/2 way around the case, keeping your device secure even when fully opened. Good for charging and offering protection while it is laying around the bedroom or house.\n\nDisadvantages:\n- The exterior mesh pocket is pretty skimpy and can barely hold my cable for the Nexus.

It's the right size for pens and pencils, I suppose, but the pocket doesn't fully close.\n- The Five Star logo on the front makes the item look very middle school-ish and cheap in my opinion. This is a good product for tossing in the purse or briefcase for transporting to work for the commute or the like, but the logo is a bit over the top.\n\nThis would be a good case for anyone who understands this product offers very little actual 'protection' for your device beyond basic scratch and debris protection.

So I took it apart, ran it under water, cleaned every part that I possibly could several times.\n\nI let it dry, and inked it. It worked for one word, then it stopped again. I tinkered with the nib, and got it to work, then it stopped again. Took it apart again, cleaned it, put it back together, inked it again, and it worked! Yay, then it didn't work. I watched the videos on youtube, and nothing seemed to get it to work again. I wanted to like it and do, when it writes. It just doesn't.", "summary": "It's a lovely pen when it works, but the problem that it doesn't.", "unixReviewTime": 1419811200}

This wireless presenter makes it easy to disconnect from the board and walk around your classroom.  This helps keep students on task during class and helps vary things a bit for you.\n\nThe layout of the remote is simple enough.  It has just the buttons you need and none of the ones that you don't.  It even has a built-in laser pointer in case you are away from the board and need to point to something in a picture or diagram.\n\nThe design is sleek and fits well in your hand.  You don't feel encumbered at all carrying it around the classroom.\n\nAgain, if you do a lot of presentations, this is the device for you.  You will not be disappointed with the freedom that it gives you.\n\nAnd as I was provided with this device by the company to test it out and give you all my honest opinion, I take these reviews very seriously.

Though it shows on the box that its metal construction, thats not completely true.  It part metal.  It measures 7 long.  It has up to 25-sheet capacity.  Though this stapler can be used either on a flat surface, or by holding it in your hand. . .  because its called the Optima Grip, its specifically designed for more handheld comfort.\n\nThe silver version of this stapler is a bit heavier at 1# 3oz.

The Canon ink is of far higher quality and has never clogged my printer. I have a Pixma & love that printer. The Canon ink can be expensive, but you save money on the multi packs (usually). I would like to see multi packs though that are double color & double black instead of 1 color & 1 black. I would also like to see packs that are ink + paper for even bigger savings. You usually get a few more pictures & prints out of each ink cartridge than it says or than you think you will though. I won't take the risk of buying the generic ink because of all the reports of it affecting the function of your printer & in my experience with the genuine ink I haven't had a single quality issue.", "summary": "better pricing", "unixReviewTime": 1377907200}

I was attempting to manual duplex print a 500 page document 100 pages at a time which is actually 50 pages 'odd' numbers, then 50 pages of 'even' numbers.  The printer got a little break after every 50 pages while it waited for me to flip the printed pages and insert them into the paper tray.  The print job was almost finished when I heard a loud \"POP\" sound come from the printer.  I jumped up to investigate and found the printer dead with a thin cloud of smoke drifting away from it.  I pulled out the USB cable first and when I touched the A/C power cord it nearly burned my fingers.  I used my sleeve to grip the plug and remove it from the power outlet.  The power cord was plugged into a UPS which had not tripped and did not show any evidence of an overload.  This printer was hardly ever used over the couple of years it has been in the office on standby.  Now the first time we ask it to step up and do a real job it explodes out of warranty.

Also has a full-sized eraser, not one of the tiny ones so common in other mechanical pencils. It looks, feels, writes, erases, and doesn't roll away just like its wooden counterpart, but never needs sharpening.\n\nThe one downside to this item is that the eraser tends to come off pretty easily in a bookbag, and the paint gets scratched VERY easily in a pocket. I like to use a little pen case anyway for pens, pencils, chalk, and USB drives, but be a little gentler with these. They don't break, but if the eraser splits or disappears, the only fix is to take one from somewhere else. You can rip them off a real #2 pencil and hollow out the bottom though.\n\nSummary: YES!

I know from prior experience that PrismaColor Premier pencils are great. They blend well and look beautiful.\n\nUnfortunately, they do have the problem of the core breaking too much, which is frustrating. I'm not sure it can be avoided, though, since they are soft core pencils, after all. To me what's worse is when one of the cores is off center, and it's just a disaster trying to sharpen it, as the lead keeps breaking AND big chunks of the wood keep splitting off. These look alright in that respect but of course I can't be sure yet. And that's rare, anyway (maybe 1 in 30 pencils is like that). If you want something harder, try the Verithin.

On a positive note, this seems like a great design for a light duty inkjet printer.  Only time will tell if the ink works long term though.  Previous inkjet printers constantly were having quality issues and needed cartridges replaced frequently.\n\nI like the little color display, much nicer than a boring B&W LCD screen.\n\nI give Epson kudos for having a decent system for entering your wireless password without an actual keyboard, this is much easier than previous designs I've used.\n\nSet up was fairly easy.  I really like the design for the ink, but beware this approach does mean that it is fairly easy to spill ink on your fingers.  Print quality seems typical of an inkjet.\n\nBeware: it only works on a wireless network that supports 2.4GHz (which I assume almost all do) (or you could use a USB cable)  I still think Epson should include a hard wired network port for those that don't want to use wireless (but want it further away than a USB cable would work).\n\nIf you are used to having a personal scanner, this is really nice to have a networked scanner for light duty usage by all computers in the house.\n\nUpdate: The printer worked nicely for several months.  But when/if it loses power it seems to lose the WiFi connection (which is a royal annoyance if your password is secure and hard to type).  Now I can't get it to connect at all (even though the network status sheet prints out that everything is fine and connected).  So I'm stuck with a printer that reports that it can't connect (\"Communications Error\") and nothing seems to help.

They will work in coloring books if you are using blending markers like Copic or Spectrum Noir so that the water doesn't mess up non water color paper. Or I suggest printing onto water color paper your design of choice. You can also try putting a thin gesso over coloring book pages to water color with, but you will need to learn to apply gesso in a delicate way.\n\nFor artist sketches, and water color journals these are awesome. I do feel that Prismacolor has quality control issues that are well known in the art community at this point, and hope that they can get their pencils back to their former premium states so we don't have broken lead, and cracking wood.\n\nThe colors are extremely bright and beautiful, and are easily layered.\n\nI would recommend these.", "summary": "Definitely A Great Set", "unixReviewTime": 1465603200}

I have other Lifetime tables, but I never thought about getting one of these until ...\n\nI use a computer stand/table in the living room so I can watch television and just have a better outdoor view (the view from my office isn't great, and my living room window overlooks a park-like yard).  I've been using a much fancier (and more expensive) \"computer stand\" for a couple of years, but it finally bit the dust (the weld that holds the desktop onto the central support column failed).  So I started the search for a replacement, one that maybe wasn't so fancy but would last longer.\n\nOf course I came to Amazon -- they have everything! -- and found a number of options.  This looked like the best fit, so I ordered it.\n\nI'm absolutely thrilled with it.  Seriously, it's even better than I expected, even with my experience with Lifetime tables (which has been excellent).  This little table is the PERFECT size for my laptop, a mug of coffee, and a couple of other items (reading glasses, etc.).  It's lightweight enough that I can easily scoot it out of the way when I need to move around (get a coffee refill, etc.).  My only quibble is that I wish it came in black, but that's absolutely NOT a deal breaker.\n\nThis feels far more stable than my old computer stand even when it was new, and it's not likely to have any similar problems.  I love that I can adjust the height, too.\n\nOverall, this is a solid 5-star item.  Would happily purchase again if the need arises.", "summary": "The PERFECT computer stand!", "unixReviewTime": 1455580800}

I have been using an HP 4680 all-in-one (Color Printer, Scanner, Copier, and Fax) for over four years, and was was looking at something that would save on the cost of ink, and also as a back-up if the HP took a turn for the worse.  I don't use the color often, so that was not a big issue when purchasing a printer, but wanted something that would connect to a network, either hard wired or with wi-fi.\n\nI'm not a computer engineer, but can set up most computer and electronic items with little difficulty, but I did have a some difficulty with this printer.  I have not used a USB cable for years, and could not locate one, so I went straight to the wi-fi setup.  For some reason, I could not get the printer or my router to communicate fully, so I connected by a LAN cable directly, and was up and running within minutes.  The entire process, with my wireless issues, was around thirty minutes, but would have been only minutes had I used the LAN cable initially, probably much quicker had I located a USB cable.  I use a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/D-Link-DIR-655-Extreme-N-Gigabit-Wireless-Router/dp/B000LIFB7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">D-Link DIR-655 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless Router</a>, which is near the printer, and although I've used the printer wireless, I have chosen to keep it hard wired to the router.\n\nI have five notebooks that are in use in my house, and the wireless printing is fairly fast.  Once a print job is submitted, the printer takes a few seconds to warm up from a sleep mode, and has the first page out within ten to fifteen seconds, with subsequent pages within two to three seconds if printing single sided.  I use the duplex mode, in an effort to save on paper, and find it takes a little longer, but far quicker than my inkjet printer.\n\nI don't find it to be an issue, but the printer is a little noisy, but quiter than most laser printers.  The only major issue I've had is printing envelopes.  I believe others mentioned this also, as it tends to wrinkle the envelope, which I believe is partly due to the heat, but also an issue with the rollers it seems.  This is not a deal breaker, as I don't print more than a few envelopes a month, but if you were printing dozens or hundreds of envelopes a month, another printer should be considered.  I've also noticed a slight curl in the paper when using the duplex mode, but that is not a permanent issue with the prints.\n\nPros -\n\n- Fast printing through a network\n- Multiple connection options (USB, Wi-Fi, LAN)\n- Automatic 2-sided printing\n- Excellent printing quality\n- Good value for the money\n- Size, requires minimal space\n\nCons -\n- Wrinkles in paper when printing envelopes\n- Limited to B/G wireless networking\n- Slight curl when using duplex mode\n\nOverall, for the price, this printer does a great job.  I have been using the printer now for over a month, and would consider purchasing another one if I needed a printer.  I have probably only printed 100 - 200 pages so far, and understand the initial toner cartridge is only rated at 700 pages, but will be replacing it with the high yield cartridge when the time comes.  I expect this printer, with the cost of the printer and toner, to pay for itself within six to nine months with savings in ink cartridges alone.\n\nUPDATE 2-26-13:\n\nI've been using this printer for over six months now.  When replacing the toner cartridge, which the original cartridge lasted far longer than I expected, I went with a generic replacement.  I wrote a review on that, and have had no problems with it.\n\nI've run over 3,000 pages on the printer, with no issues.  In fact, with what I paid for the printer and the replacement toner cartridge, I have more than saved on buying ink for my ink printer.  I still use my multifunction ink printer, as it scans, faxes, copies, and prints in color, but it gets less than 5% of the total use, with this printer getting over 95% use.  I have had the printer connected to the network, and no computer has had issues with printing to it, and the printer has always begun printing within ten seconds of executing print on the computer.  Since my initial review, I upgraded to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/WD-My-Net-N900-HD-Dual-Band-Router-Wireless-N-WiFi-Router-Accelerate-HD/dp/B007KZQMO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">WD My Net N900 HD Dual Band Router Wireless N WiFi Router Accelerate HD</a>&nbsp;and have had no issues with the connection and the printer.\n\nAs I stated, I have already paid for this printer in the amount I have saved in ink alone, and the quality is very good.  I still recommend this to anyone wanting a network printer, for a reasonable price, that will be economical in the long run.", "summary": "Economical and Fast", "unixReviewTime": 1345766400}

I put it all over my hands and arms, and on my legs below the knee.  My hands do feel a bit odd after putting it on--remember doing pottery at summer camp and afterward you'd sort of wash your hands but after they dried you'd still have clay residue on them?

That review has been deleted after owning it for an extended amount of time and seeing how invasive the software has become over that time.\n\nThe problem is how intrusive the software is--five applications run in the background at all times. There are \"HP Solution Center\" pop-up reminders to buy new ink, pop-ups when printing, frequent updates to download due to what must have been faulty software, etc. I also began receiving regular advertisement e-mails from HP. The on-screen pop-ups go over any application you are currently working on, and interrupt it. The download updates seem to be necessary, because my computer and the printer frequently \"lost their connection,\" with the computer being unable to access the printer--it often either would not work at all, or prints blank pages. This appears to be a fault on the HP side, since their updates for this printer usually list connectivity as what they are trying to improve upon. For someone on dial-up, the updates are unrealistically large. A recent update was 27 megs, took 1 1/2 hours to download, then indicated it was corrupt and the download had failed.\n\nEventually I uninstalled the software package, and then reinstalled only the basic software through custom install. Since then, it has operated more like a normal printer.\n\nOn the plus side, this printer has an option for higher ink capacity, with \"xl\" version cartridges available (though they're rather expensive). The on-deck gauge of ink levels is really a nice feature.", "summary": "Liked at first, but software becomes invasive", "unixReviewTime": 1236902400}

No more lugging the box to be shipped to your bathroom scale.\n\nThis scale is very simple to set up. It comes in three parts...the external display (which makes it easy to read the result because it is movable and brightly lit) with included AAA batteries (can also use AC with included adapter), the scale and a cable that connects the two. Not much more to say, you put the item on the scale and read the result (lb/oz/kg/g).\n\nI compared the results to another Smart Weigh scale as shown in the video. I must say I was surprised that they were not the same. This product came in lower every time. Not sure which one was off, but I'm guessing it was this one. I am impressed that it can weigh up to 110 lbs!\n\nThe scale comes with a 10 year limited warranty. I look forward to using this to make my shipping easier to price, however, I am a bit concerned that accuracy may be a problem. I'll keep you posted.\n\nSample provided for review.", "summary": "Great for home and small business use", "unixReviewTime": 1395187200}

The design on my old Brother HL-2170W was far better, you would put all the paper in a tray that slid inside the printer and it could hold much more paper.\n\nI would recommend the Samsung CLP-315W if you could get it at a good price, I got mine for $130 shipped.", "summary": "Great Wireless Color Laser Printer for light/medium duty use.", "unixReviewTime": 1266710400}

B. Hoyos", "reviewText": "For many years, I've been storing bank statements in a standard 2 inch white binder with round rings.  The cover material is not PVC free and ink from the bank statements has adhered to both undersides of the front and back covers.  Furthermore, the binder has become stuffed to overflowing.  I can't comfortably squeeze any more bank statements inside.  Thankfully, the Amazon Vine Program offered me the Avery Nonstick Heavy-Duty EZD Reference View 2 Inch White Binder.\n\n  I also own an Avery View SlantRing 1 1/2 inch White Binder in which I store computer related documents.  I can safely vouch that Avery makes very durable binders that last a long time.  I posted a digital photograph depicting three binders together; it mainly depicts the differences in their rings.  The Avery binder in the left of the photograph has the 2 inch EZD rings, the standard binder in the middle has the 2 inch round rings and the Avery binder in the right has the 1 1/2 inch slant rings.\n\n  The Avery Nonstick Heavy-Duty EZD Reference View 2 Inch White Binder would make a great album dedicated to the memory of a departed loved one.  The cover material is PVC Free.  One can put a photograph of a loved one inside and not worry that it will be ruined.  Also, I like that the ink from the pages won't adhere to the undersides of the front and back covers.  At work, I am constantly having to tear pages off the covers where the ink from my directives has stuck to them.  You definitely don't want this to happen to important letters, post cards and other souvenirs and mementos from departed loved ones.  You want to preserve your memories intact for as long as possible.\n\n  The ONE TOUCH EZD Rings make it easier for the elderly and infirm to open the binder.  The four pockets (two in the front and two in the back inside covers) in lieu of the normal two pockets makes it easier to store booklets, pamphlets, notes, etc.  I have posted a digital photograph of the notebook with four of my computer booklets inside the pockets.  The binder covers are extra wide so that dividers don't stick out.  I have downloaded and posted the product description that was inserted into the front cover.  It provides a listing of all its attributes compared to the other type binders.\n\n  I transferred all the bank statements from my standard 2 inch binder into the Avery Nonstick Heavy-Duty EZD Reference View 2 Inch White Binder.  I must honestly say that there isn't much room for many more statements.  I will have to either reuse my beat up standard 2 inch binder or remove the bank statements from the new Avery binder and put them back into the old standard one and use the new Avery one for future storage.  I hate to use the expensive new Avery binder for storing bank statements, receipts, classroom notes, etc., that should be eventually destroyed.  The Avery Nonstick Heavy-Duty EZD Reference View 2 Inch White Binder is more appropriate for serving as a scrapbook for safely storing the cherished memories of a loved one whether they are alive or departed.\n\nJoseph B.

It broke within three months (continued to report that there was no paper loaded, despite there being plentiful paper there).  HP was good about replacing it promptly.  It prints text FAST.  The problem is getting to the point that it has started printing.  As others have mentioned, it takes this printer eons to initialize.  Sometimes, it even decides to reset at completely random times.  And the noise...you'd think it was about to spew plastic and metal parts out the paper hole with the intensity of churning and grinding you hear.  Then there is the continued \"finickiness\" with regard to loading paper.  You've got to position it just right or suffer the blinking \"paper out\" light.\n\nAnd then there is the ink.  As others have mentioned, there was a class action suit against HP because they didn't make it clear how ink was used by certain printers.  This causes most users to go through their colored ink faster than they should.  For example, with this printer, even though you may be printing a simple black and white text document, you have to click through four settings (Properties/Features/Print in grayscale/Black Ink Only) to ensure that no colored ink is used in printing your simple black and white document.\n\nThe things this printer gets right (solid wireless performance straight out of the box and fast printing) are vastly overshadowed by all the hassle we've had to go through to get things done.\n\nAgain, as others have mentioned, HP denies all allegations yet has settled the suit.

Courier, for example, looks as if the characters are a bit \"thinner\" on ink than other printers give.\nLong term complaint:  I found that the print quality goes down drastically, some say after moving the unit uncarefully without removing the drum/toner, though it didn't seem to be the cause for us.  This was never a problem with mom's, only mine, which admittedly was moved more and used more.  It took a REAL good cleaning of the entire drum unit, sloshing it down with alcohol-soaked rags, including meticulous cleaning of the entire green print drum.  It prints as good as new again.  Whether I'll have to repeat the cleaning later, I don't know.\nBut would I buy another Brother printer?  Without a doubt, yes!", "summary": "Nice printer, grainy late in life", "unixReviewTime": 1052438400}

There may be instances when a paper receipt might be desired, but shipping information is kept online by the USPS and eBay and others, so only those who need a paper receipt should buy these labels.\n\nThese are designed for use for eBay shipping, USPS Click-N-Ship service, pbSmartPostage, and Stamps.com (the latter is mentioned in the instructions on the back of the label but not on the box). Avery supplies Design & Print and MS Word templates on their web site.  Avery advises using the templates for their 5127 labels and warns that if you're shipping UPS, you should feed the labels with the receipt first.\n\nThey are designed for BOTH inkjet and laser, which is nice.  On the shipping web page, there is usually a checkbox for which you can choose a receipt or not.\n\nAfter peeling off the label, the receipt can be separated at a perforation.  The perfs are a  little stubborn and it would be nice if they were easier to separate.\n\nLets compare costs: These 27900 labels are 38 cents each (for 100 labels) and 20 cents (for 500 labels). The inkjet label Avery 8126 has 2 labels per sheet for 16 cents per label (for 50 labels).  The 5126 version (laser) has 2 labels per sheet for 11.5 cents (for 200 labels).  So you're paying almost twice as much to be able to print the receipt.\n\nAnother factor is the label stock itself: there is some show-through because the labels are relatively thin, while the 8126 and 5126 labels have TrueBlock technology which uses a more opaque material so that it covers any printing under the label.\n\nAdhesive quality is good and the labels fed properly through my laser printer from both the tray or manual feed.  The laser printing did not rub off.\n\nBuy these is you really need the receipt.

It's heavy with rubber foot pads, so it doesn't slide when you put weight on it.  It's sturdy steel with a rough, sandpaper-like texture to prevent your feet from slipping.  And it's adjustable via the screws and wingnuts underneath.\n\nThe foot rest has essentially 3 different degrees of freedom.  First, the foot platform sits is connected to the mount platform via 1 bolt in the middle of either side.  So, it pivots to create a flat platform a wedge shape.  The mount platform is connected via 2 thumb-screws and wingnuts on either side.  The screws sit in a specially formed channel in order to more easily lock the configuration you desire.  It's hard to explain without a picture, but this is where you further adjust the angle you want.\n\nHaving thumbscrews and wingnuts is convenient.  It means you don't have to pull out the tools when adjusting the foot rest.  But moving the foot rest around via the channels in the mount platform is not entirely easy, but I don't see it being something you need to do quite often anyway.\n\nThe price of the foot rest is a little high in my opinion.  You could probably build something like this for a lot cheaper if you had the necessary tools and skill.  Most people don't, so they'll pay a premium for a quality product like this.\n\nI find this product particularly useful because not only is it comfortable, but my office is in my basement which has a tile floor that gets quite cold in the winter.

It looks cheaper and cheaper over time, and most of the plastic utensils/office paraphernalia I've ever bought have broken--quickly. This raiser, however, is all metal, with the exception of the rear leg ends which are hard plastic, I suppose to prevent scratching the surface the raiser is resting on, and perhaps to increase friction at the rear. I'm also very glad I can elevate my laptop--whether at my sitting or standing desk--more than high enough to prevent the awkward neck strain I'd earned from years of using large textbooks to elevate my laptop. The raiser also adjusts intuitively, but as an added security to preserve the symmetry you expect from the opposite right/left halves of the raiser, rotational graduation is superimposed on each metal joint-adjuster as you'd expect, with positive and negative rotation allowed as you hold the leg being adjusted in the positive-x-axis orientation. So you can easily check both legs are oriented symmetrically. Another note on the joints. They feel very stiff. It's a bit of a challenge to move them, but this only makes me feel more secure about the positioning of the legs and the integrity of my laptop.\n\nMy only regrets: that the only colors offered were red (??) and white. Red, I have no idea why. White is likely to become dirty quickly. I'd have preferred gray or even black. And I'd also have preferred the rotational degree system on the  joints to have been etched into the metal, as experience teaches me the black painted-on numbers are likely to ware off over time, and this well engineered contraption appears likely to last a very long time. But I haven't taken off a star for either of these complaints because this is the ONLY laptop raiser I've found anywhere in a decade of looking that is all metal. If your laptop is very valuable to you and the additional cost is not prohibitive for you, this laptop raiser provides stability, ergonomic integrity, and promised longevity all in an aesthetically appealing design, assuming you can live with the periodic gentle cleanings the soft white finish likely requires.", "summary": "The best laptop raiser I've found over ten years searching", "unixReviewTime": 1464998400}

But onto the product.\n\nThe wheels seem to be made of heavy duty materials and everything is very solid. I needed some replacement castor wheels for a table that I have had for awhile. The wheels on the table just got too gunked up with pet hair and who knows what else but they weren't rolling freely and would get jammed up more often than not. So I was excited to give these new caster wheels a go. They fit perfectly onto my table and were virtually fool proof to install. It took a little bit of effort to remove the old wheels but the new caster wheels just popped right in. Now my old table glides effortlessly on hard flooring or carpeted.\n\nOverall I'm very pleased with this set of caster wheels. They really get the job done and I don't have to get a new table anytime soon now that I have brand new wheels on it.\n\nThe first photo is of my old dirty caster wheels and the second is of the new nicer wheels.\n\nI received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion of the seller's product. My review  is a real representation of my experience with this product. I'm just a regular Amazon shopper who purchases most online items from Amazon and I enjoy sharing my experiences with other shoppers.
