I got the Luxe Bidet 320 but I thought the nozzles were adjustable and they are not adjustable and the femine wash it doesn't hit my front it hits my rear like the rear wash does but I have postioned myself anyway I can cannot get the female part to the front part. There is a learning curve to this since they are not adjustable you have to postion yourself on the toilet seat so it will wash your rear without me turning a little on the seat it hits my right butt cheek but that is not a deal breaker for me I did think about returning it over the female wash since I can't get it to hit the front but haven't my boyfriend put this on for me and had to drill a hole in the cabinet of the sink so we could hook up the hot water so I hate to have him to take it off and return it to order another one and then have him to put it back on because I really like it. I 1st got it just for when my back goes out and it's hard to wipe you bum when you can't hardly turn at all with you back going out and mine goes out a couple of times a year but I have liked it so much I use it almost all the time but still have to keep toilet paper for my front and for guest most guest are like no way lol!!! But I didn't get it for them anyway. I will get another one for the other bathroom but probably be another brand I want one with adjustable nozzles and I really wish this one had adjustable nozzles because I really like this one and I like that it has a lever instead of a knob for the water pressure and adjusting from hot to cold. Most people say the toilet seat slides after adding the bidet on my toilet I have a snap on lid instead of the kind that has screws to hold them down. Mine came with the toilet it is a snap on with a slow closing lid my toilet seat barely even moves with the bidet on so maybe if your seat is moving a lot or if you are constantly tighten your seat down like I was doing in my other bathroom get you one with a snap on lid they don't move at all with no bidet and barely move with the bidet on. I changed my seat out in other bathroom when I was having to tighten it up every other week. I really like the snap on lids the only thing about them is I haven't been able to find the snap on kind in a soft seat but that's fine with me because the crack too easy anyway. If it had adjustable nozzles and if the female wash clean the front part I would give it 5 stars and would be ordering this one for other bathroom too. If you want warm water when using it you can turn on nozzle cleaner let it run for a few before turning it on to wash or if you turn your sink on with hot water running let it run till it starts to warm up it will warm up quicker to the toilet you will have cold water that is left in the pipes but will warm up quickly if you run hot water in sink 1st. Too me this one cost too much not to have adjustable nozzles you can buy one cheaper with adjustable nozzles.

I first discovered them at Home Depot but they discontinued them after about a year.  My shelving projects take a long time to build and I often change the configuration.  I refused to switch to a non-supported shelf bracket system and found that Amazon carries many of the Fast-Mount products (all except the 6' wall brackets).  The price was on par with Home Depot and I didn't need to drive 70 miles to pick them up - plus, no sales tax!  I ordered about 6 dozen shelf brackets of various sizes and more 4' wall brackets than I think I'll ever need.\n\nI have most often used the 2' deep shelf brackets spaced at 32\" centers mounted on the 6' wall brackets.  Along one 16 foot wall of my garage, I store more than 2000 pounds of lumber (on 5 levels) with no hint of strain.  One note of caution:  I anchored the wall brackets into the studs using 6\"x 5/16\" lag bolts because I knew I would have a huge load on them.  This is way beyond the normal 3\"x 3/16\" screws that I use most places.  The secret to the strength is the angled supports under the shelf bracket.\n\nI called the John Sterling Company, maker of the Fast Mount system and inquired about the size differences between the shelf and wall brackets purchased from Home Depot a year earlier and those from Amazon.  The Amazon shelf brackets were about an inch shorter and the wall brackets were about a quarter inch smaller (mounts closer to the wall).  They explained that the cost of steel had risen so much that instead of charging more for their products, they chose to cut down on the sizes a little without compromising the load rating.  They are apparently correct.  I find no difference in performance and the older products are compatible for the most part with the new ones.\n\nShipments of these rather heavy items came in very small packages, often one wall bracket at a time.  Each one of 40 brackets was carefully wrapped and labeled individually.  Except for disposing of the huge cardboard pile after unwrapping, it was  LOTS easier than going to Home Depot.  I just hope Amazon will continue to carry Fast-Mount products for many years to come so I can supply my next shelf project.", "summary": "The best shelving system ever!", "unixReviewTime": 1186358400}

Haven't even used someone else's before. So I would really like to thank everyone who took the time to write a review on it and the other scroll saws at amazon. It was the primary reason I chose the Dewalt.\n\nI make boxe's, all kinds, shapes and size's. I have pretty much quit using metal fastener's, hinges, knobs, catch's, etc. I really enjoy making my own out of wood. Have been using a multitude of power and hand tools to make my own, but thought a scroll saw would allow me to make even smaller, more intricate pieces.\n\nAssembly was very quick and easy. I added rubber feet to the base of the saw as it will sit on a workbench not on its own stand. Have a small shop, every thing has to be mobile. I also purchased a foot switch as everyone I talked with about scroll saws seems to feel it is a necessary safety feature. With a combination of the rubber feet and a rubber pad, the machine doesn't move at all, even on speed 8. Vibration is very minimal, and luckily the saw is at the perfect heighth when sitting on the bench. The dust blower works adequately, but I am going to rig a vacuum source up somehow. Changing blades is a bit of a challenge at first, but I think with time and practice it will become much easier. I also have rigged a swing arm lamp to use with the saw, old tired eyes ya know, need all the help I can get.\n\nI mostly use hardwoods, and thickness's up to 1\" so blade selection and speed are going to be critical items. So far I probably have spent 10-15 hours just practicing, using differant woods, blades, speeds, feed rate, etc., and taking a few notes to help later on. I am very happy with the results so far. Have made two sets of decorative hinges out of mesquite and am very pleased with the small kerf I was able to achieve and how well they fit and function. They took a bit of time to produce, but I know that will change as I become more practiced and comfortable with the machine's ability and of course my own.\n\nI spent a lot of time researching scroll saw's before purchasing the Dewalt. It will not be used everyday, but hopefully will be used a lot for a long time. So I wanted a machine that would last a long time and I believe the Dewalt will do the job for me.\n\nRecommend it highly.", "summary": "EXTREMELY SATISFIED....", "unixReviewTime": 1136764800}

Another bonus is that I don't have to purchase and extra charger because I can simply flip open the silicone port on the side , plug in the flat USB cable and the included AC adapter into a wall receptacle.  I do love flat cables, but one of the most interesting things was that the cable has a Lighting end, a micro USB, and USB ends.  I absolutely love the versatility of this cable and have never seen anything quite like it.  Each end is covered to keep the crud out.\n\nThis Samic cree is a small, but very powerful LED tactical flashlight that's perfect for camping, generalized household use, or to put in that emergency kit.  The lighting is so much more powerful than that of an old-fashioned flashlight and since I've been using this type of flashlight, I've never looked back.  It will light up an entire room and, as many in this size group, can be seen for almost 200 yards outside.  It's not touted as being waterproof, but certainly must have an IPX4 rating or higher, making it water-resistant.  It comes with a convenient case and wrist lanyard with a metal swivel quick-release snap.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n  CREE XML L2 1198 Lumens Ultra Brightness.

IPX-7 Waterproof\n  Stands Up Securely On A Flat Surface To Serve As Candle\n\nA single charge varies, depending on the mode you are using.  There are five modes:  Low / Medium / High  / 10HZ Strobe  /  S.O.S.  There are three simple blue LED indicators that give me an idea as to how much charge I have left. This cree will last approximately 50,000 hours, a real plus.  I'm not quite sure how long the battery itself will last, but they can be replaced.  The silicone control button is a light action one, making it easy to use.  A long press will shut it off rapidly.\n\nThe bright black anodized aluminum casing is quite solid and definitely tactical in nature.  I can place it on one of its ribbed sides and it won't roll and I can also place it on end.  If need be, it could be an excellent emergency beacon.  This is an excellent handheld flashlight that would be an excellent one to add to that emergency kit.  It's easy to operate and with those different modes, a very versatile one.  I do like the LED lights and the longevity factor.  There won't be any replacing the cree because it will last for 50,000 hours.  I don't know how many times I've had to search around for a small replacement bulb for my old-fashioned ones (which aren't any more water-resistant than this one).\n\nSample provided for review.", "summary": "A high-quality, 5-mode flashlight that's a perfect addition to any emergency kit ...", "unixReviewTime": 1436832000}

But I guess anodizing it black would add to the cost of the product.\n\nSome tips from my experience.\n\n1) Practice on a piece of scrap drywall or cardboard to convince yourself how easy this is.\n2) I would consider taping at least one corner for an anchor point.\n3) Scrape off all excess spackling so that the spackling in the holes is flush with the thickness of the template.  This process is like spreading peanut butter thin except there is no bread to flake on you.  No need to knockdown if you scrape off excess.  I tried knocking down and the results are not as good vs if I didn't.\n4) Clean off the bottom surface of the template between applications as the excess spackling accumulates\n5) To avoid lines at the edge of the template when stepping across different sections of the drywall have a little overlap and don't press down too hard over the section you already worked on.\n6) Make sure you clean the template immediately after you are done so the holes don't clog up.  Process is like scraping off the peanut butter.  Rinse with water.  It does take a while to get the spackling out of the tiny holes in the template.\n\nIf you got a larger area to do then I would recommend spraying with a machine unless you have a lot of patience to do this half square foot at a time.  But for small repair jobs Pirate Patch is perfect.", "summary": "If you can make a peanut butter jelly sandwich this is easier.", "unixReviewTime": 1382659200}

In the long rung I paid about 2-3 times what I could have and had the same quality but much higher quantity of fuses and paid less for a cheap little puller.\n\nAs some reviews have said, the fuses in the kit(s) can not be tested in spite of coming with a tester that has instructions for testing.  The fuses are the cheaper fuses, that although have the test ports (holes in the top) the probes can not reach the metal contacts, even if they were small enough in diameter to actually reach all the way in.\n\nI'm sure the fuses themselves will work fine but for the cost and hype over a nearly worthless tester, there are better options.  Oh, and the clamsell package which would make it easier to keep them secure, is secured to where it's nearly impossible to open without damage enough to keep it from closing well enough.  I didn't expect a \"case\" but a package that would be good enough to use to store them.\n\nI did have a fuse to replace so I checked and found very few fuses in that car that could even be tested.  Most mini's do not have test ports and the puller is nearly if not completely ineffective in pulling them because of size.  It works well pulling and installing the standard size fuses though.  For half the money I would have bought a variety package of both sizes, got a cheap $1 puller and some kind of cheap bag or case and put that in the vehicles for storage.  I'm disappointed in Bussmann which has been a name I've been familiar with for years and years.  I might expect something like this being dumped on Woot, but not retailed on Amazon.\n\n1 positive I can say, the fuses do have the amp stamped on the top for those that aren't familiar with the color codes.", "summary": "They work but....I'm disappointed in Bussmann", "unixReviewTime": 1463443200}

Will update with any problems.\n\nEdit 5/2015: So I've been using this thing daily for quite some time now, and I just recently realized an easy fix to this light's only problem: the lid requires almost constant tightening. Just poor machining I guess, there is metal dust in the threads when you use it. Anyways, just put a piece of foil around 1/8 inch thick above the spring in the body of the light. It'll keep the battery in contact so you don't need to constantly tighten the light.\n\nDespite the constant need for adjustment without modification, it's a great light for the price. The battery life is surprisingly good as well. I've changed my battery twice in the entire time I've owned it, if I recall correctly. As I mentioned, I use it daily.", "summary": "Bright and cheap!", "unixReviewTime": 1385337600}

After installation when I tested it I found that I wasn't able to lock it by pressing the Schlage button. I've gone through the troubleshooting steps, disabled / enabled the Turn Lock feature, and reinstalled many times. Finally I think this should be a defective one. Schlage asks customers not to return to the retailer, but their customer service was not available until Monday, so I asked Amazon for a replacement, and Amazon was able to deliver my replacement on Sunday - even before Schlage customer service's next business hour. I'm not sure how Schlage would handle this case, like how soon would they ship a replacement out, whether they'll ship a replacement before receiving my old one, whether they'll cover the two-way shipment costs, or whether they'll agree to ship me a replacement at all. So today I received my replacement from Amazon. After installing it I tested to make sure that the locking feature is working. However I found that it was able to be unlocked by simply pressing the Schlage button. Again I went through troubleshooting steps, reinstalled many times, nothing helps.\n\nBy comparing the in-door part of the two deadbolts, I figured out that the first one is missing the cam. Without the cam the deadbolt would think itself being in locked status forever and refuse to engage the extractor when pressing the Schlage button. I have yet found the issue with the second deadbolt but it could only be that either the signal wire is broken or that the switch failed to close when the deadbolt is locked.\n\nShould I ask for another replacement? I guess not. This is a serious security product but it was made like a cheap toy. Now both units are packed and waiting to be dropped at UPS, and Schlage customer service has yet entered business hour.

The plastic is very sturdy and installation was easy and the cover never wiggles or adjusts or moves from its place.

It was taken out of the forge, painted, assembled and put in a box.  The base is no where close to flat.  Working it with a variety of files and then various grits of paper and finally polishing with rouge and a buffing pad (Dremel)  I got a nice flat polished base.

Even on high it's relatively quiet where you hear just the wind. On low, you hardly notice it yet you can still feel the cool breeze. But as things go there are issues.\n\nIf this is the first fan for the room that you are installing it in chances are you are replacing a light fixture. Problem is this is just a fan so you won't get your light back. The description didn't say without light and every fan I've ever seen in any home had a light. But don't assume they all come with one - this one does NOT.\n\nEasy installation is relative to the situation. And I doubt most DIY installers actually confirm there is enough support to hang this. You can't just replace the light fixture, you need to make sure there is something solid to bolt this to. I had to crawl up into the attic and install a 2x4. Overall it took me a good afternoon to complete the project.\n\nThis ceiling fan is not expensive for a ceiling fan and the quality indicates that. Right off the first step to installing this the holes didn't line up for two brackets. I had to do a little bending to make it work. Then it calls for an 11/32 wrench - why 11/32? Do they actually save money on such an odd size? But the nuts were actually 9/32 which means they were too small. Fortunately, this wasn't required to support the fan. The screws to drive into the 2x4 to hold the fan were cheap and rounded off and I couldn't completely tighten them. Fortunately I could get them out and replaced them with quality screws. Other screws requiring a philips driver weren't deep enough to get a decent grip to tighten but with patience and care I eventually got it done. There is an included weight for the chain extension but nothing to hold it on to the chain. I decided it was too long anyway and didn't use the extension.\n\nOne step I added was try to hang the fan housing to see exactly how low it would hang and found I preferred the shortest tube. Which does make it a little tighter space to do the wiring.\n\nIt looks like a fan, nothing stylish about it, the main housing looks like a spaceship. But we didn't expect it to be a centerpiece... It doesn't look bad just looks like a fan.\n\nOne feature is that it is designed for outside use like for a porch. Obviously, not directly in the rain but it's supposed to be waterproof against moisture.\n\nOverall, once the installation was complete it works great and we will appreciate it on the hot days. It also can be set to reverse to spread the heat out during winter which we will have to test later. But now we have to figure out a new light...", "summary": "Works great and is relatively quiet but a few issues", "unixReviewTime": 1497052800}

I started out with a 3M one that had worked fine, but apparently they had so many people on their network that changing the system temp from a phone, webpage, or iPad took over 10 minutes to actually update my thermostat.  I got tired of that delay, did some searching, and picked the Ecobee over the Nest.  I've been using my Ecobee for the last 7 months or so, and love it.  When this came up on the Vine program, I almost passed since I had JUST installed the Ecobee recently, and didn't want to go through the hassle of changing out.  But the voice control intrigued me, since I have a lot of things in my house controlled either by voice or by wireless.\n\nThe installation was actually incredibly easy becuase of my Ecobee.  Since that has a control board that I wired into the furnace, all I really needed to do was pull the wires from that to the thermostat, and connect them directly to the furnace.  That way I still had all the Ecobee stuff connected in case I wanted to revert.  My total install time took about 5 minutes.  I didn't screw the thermostat to my wall, I'm waiting for my final decision before taking that last step.\n\nWhite, Green, Red, Yellow, and the constant power C wire were all that's needed.  The connection is a simple push connection, with the wires held in by the gripping of the connector.  There are no set screws.  However, there's not much room for wire under the thermostat, so make sure you're wires will be able to be pushed back into the wall if needed, since unlike some other Honeywell thermostats, there's not a lot of space here to bend wires over.\n\nOnce it was connected and I returned power to the furnace, the thermostat lit up and offered the setup options.  Language, then type of furnace (high efficiency or below 90% efficiency), type of heat source (gas/oil, etc).  How many stages.  Once past that, it offered to set up the schedule now or wait.  I remember another reviewer mentioning how easy setup was at the screen, so I tried it.  And that reviewer was spot on.  This screen programming was about the easiest I've ever done for any thermostat, screen or PC / Web setup.  You can pick days that will bunch together on the same schedule, then set wake, leave, return, and sleep times, and temps for all.  Fan circulation also has a schedule it can follow the same way.  I actually like that part better than the Ecobee since there was no way to NOT circulate during some part of the schedule.  This way I can have the fan not turn on at night, for example, if it wakes up my 10 year old to hear the fan cycling on and off several times an hour.  However, with the Ecobee I could specify how much time each hour it circulated, down to as little as 5 minutes.  That way I could tweak it for more or less fan runtime keeping the house freshened.  Back to the schedule setup, I only needed two schedules, the days I work (M,T,TH,FR) and the days I don't (W,S,SU).  That was quick and easy since you just push the days involved in the current programming \"group\" that will use the same settings and times.\n\nThe final step on the thermostat gives you the webpage, MAC address, and PIN for the thermostat.  Open that on a computer, tablet, whatever (I used my iPad mini) and create an account, give it the MAC of the thermostat and the pin, and it's linked.  It was that simple.  I then downloaded their IOS app to my iPad and iPhone, and once I gave that the account I created (email address and password used to link back to the mothership) it was online as well.\n\nMost thermometers can vary up to +- 1 to 2 degrees.  My 3M thermostat, between it's variance and the wall clock/thermometer on the wall above it, I had 3 degrees of difference.  The Ecobee had about 1 degree difference.  This one split the difference, and it showed about 2 degrees more than the thermometer above it.  But after 15 or so minutes of my setting everything up, getting the iPad and my Surface pro linked, it settled into the same temp as the thermometer above it.  This is a first for me.\n\nI'm only about 8 to 10 feet from it when I sit on the couch, and it's very easy to read.  You can set the inactive brightness level as well, which I like since after my son goes to bed, the lights are off in the great room while I do remote client work from my couch.  This way it's not just turned off, I can still read it.  It displays the indoor temp and humidity, but the temp is the largest number, easy to see.  What can be more difficult from farther away is the outdoor temp and humidity as well as the indoor humidity.  The current \"Set to\" temp font is about twice as large as the outdoor font, so it's easier to read from a distance.\n\nThere is a \"Smart Response\" setting which I like, that learns the time needed to go to various temps, so when you set it to be say, 65 at 7 AM, it'll turn on sooner so that it hits the target at the time you want, rather than start from wherever it is at that time to try to reach the temperature you desired.\n\nThe color options are nice - I've never had one that let me change the \"theme\" of the display.  You're generally stuck with what they want you to see.  The Ecobee had a nice screen as its default, multi color and better than the 3M one was, but this one is actually more useful for me.  Larger temp numbers easier to see from a distance.  I'm not a fan of white backgrounds on things like this, so for me it's more visually appealing than the Ecobee as well.\n\nYou can also select 12/24 hour clock, which for me is a biggie since I am a veteran, and prefer a 24 hour clock.\n\nYou can override the default \"4 changes per day\" setting and select only 2 if you wish.\n\nFor business use, there's a \"preoccupancy purge\" option that will get fresh air going before the beginning of the day.  Not needed for me since I leave the fan in circulate mode, so it cycles the fan throughout the day anyway to keep air fresh.\n\nHowever, that's the downside of this unit.  One reason I picked the Ecobee last summer was becuase I have a whole house dehumidifier unit (HRV) and the current Ecobee, while not able yet to do advanced things with it (although they say that's in their development timeline) can at least cycle it on and off with the furnace, so I know I'm pushing stale air out and bringing in fresh air - which is especially important this time of year, when we've spent so many days with our highs being below zero that the house never gets opened up at all.  With this thermostat, I'd still have to deal with doing things manually.\n\nI was disappointed in the Honeywell website - I wanted to find a PDF with the voice command options, but they don't even have the manual available.  When you go to the support site to the \"Find My Manual\" section, and type in this part number, there are zero hits.\n\nThere is supposed to be a voice command card in the box, but I can't find one.  And without the commands listed on teh website so far, its a bit frustrating.  I finally found one on wifithermostat.com though.\n\nSo you can say \"I'm cold/warm\" and it adjusts one degree.  You can specify \"Make it 5 degrees warmer/cooler.\"  Or \"I'm very warm/cold.\"  But things I would've thought obvious you can't, such as \"Turn the fan on.\"  And for some reason it seems to have problems with some numbers, so when you say something, it's a random chance whether it hits what you wanted or doesn't.  Or \"I'm sorry, I do not understand.\"  I tried 20 times to get it to be exactly 60 degrees as the set point and not once did it get it right.  Trying different numbers had similar effects, getting it right less than half the time.\nAnd oddly enough one time it said it couldn't contact the server, so it didn't even try to figure out what I said, which seems to imply that the voice function will fail if it's not used on an internet connection.  The straight out thermostat touch screen will, but apparently not even the voice command side of things, which for me was unexpected, I had assumed that was built into the unit.\n\nAs far as internet response times (which was why I replaced the original 3M I had), this one is quick like the Ecobee.  I set the desired temp with my iPad, and in about 6 seconds my thermostat updated and the furnace turned on.  I changed the setting on the thermostat itself, and it was about 4 seconds for my computer to see the update on the webpage.  I was pleased with the quick update time.\n\nI love the display.  It's the nicest one out there, and I may keep this simply for that reason, at least until Ecobee can do more advanced controls with an HRV unit.  But for the price, I don't see how this is worth that much more than a standard WIFI thermostat simply becuase you can use voice.  It's actually faster to use your phone / iPad / computer than it is to use voice anyway, due to the delay after saying, \"Hello thermostat\" then waiting for it to acknowledge it, then waiting for it to get to the listening screen, then waiting for it to process the command, then waiting for it to act on it (or screw it up, and having to correct it multiple times).", "summary": "Love the display, but voice commands are flakey and not worth the extra cost", "unixReviewTime": 1389484800}

I bought and used it for homeowner level chores only, even though I am a 25 year veteran of the building industry.  Neither the tool nor the  batteries have been abused in any way.  The tool is fine.  In fact it's an EXCELLENT product!\n\nMy only problem is the batteries!\n\nThe two batteries I got with this tool stopped holding a charge about three monts ago, despite VERY light use since purchase.  I have used many, MANY different cordless tools in my professional building career, starting with Makita in 1981 (also excellent tools).  I have never, EVER experienced the kind of disappointing service from ANY cordless tool battery as I have with these. In fact, I have Makita NI-CAD batterirs that are still working after 8 years! The replacement costs for Ridgid, Lithium-Ion batteries are unbelievable -- especially since the whole LI technology will soon be upstaged!  IMHO, the cost of replacement (even at Amazon) is preposterous, because ANY battery that sells for this price should perform very well for at least three to four times longer than these.  I hope Ridgid tool users are not victims of the morally reprehensible practice of \"planned obsolescence\"!  I keep hearing how proud you folks are of your tools and your warranties.  I hope your policies rise above the rest of the power tool industry.\n\nPlease advise: What can I do to fix this problem?\n\nKind regards,", "summary": "Excellent performance, but not for long!", "unixReviewTime": 1290643200}

It's a very compact bulb - it's roughly 2.75 inches from base to top. A very Munchkin-size bulb, but it puts out a surprisingly ample amount of light.\n\nI'm using it in an articulating desk lamp that I use for close-up hobby work using a magnifying stand. It replaces a compact florescent bulb rated at 23 watts. I'm far more satisfied with the LED bulb than the CF bulb. The light output is about the same between the two, but the 3-watt LED light is clearer and less yellow, making it more comfortable for viewing. Most important, there's no heat output, so I can position the bulb close to what I'm working on and not have to deal with a hot bulb.\n\nThe light output is rated at 250 lumens, so this is not something that will light up the full room. But, for close-up work, it's perfect.\n\nThe build quality is at the usual G7 standards, which is to say it is excellent. Very solid feeling. I've yet to have any problem with the durability of a G7 bulb.\n\nThis is an excellent choice for instances where you need a compact bulb. Highly recommend.\n[Sample provided for review]", "summary": "Compact size, excellent functionality", "unixReviewTime": 1375228800}

I actually ended up using the Delta-supplied drain pop-up connector parts as the Danze pull rod was a bit snug in the pre-drilled hole in the Delta base, so it's best to not toss any parts out before completing your install.

Colonna", "reviewText": "STOP!  Before you buy this switch make absolutely sure the place you want to install it has a NEUTRAL wire.  This does not mean a \"white\" wire.  You will often find in older homes, your switch can have just 3 wires, load, live and ground. This will often be black, white, and green.\n\nWhen you take the HS200 out of the box you will see it has FOUR wires: 2 black, 1 white, 1 green.  The 2 black wires act as live and load, and while interchangeable on the switch, you CANNOT connect both blacks from the switch to the single black wire in your box.  No matter what anyone tells you, please DO NOT try to override this configuration by wiring your TP-Link neutral (white) to a green ground wire.\n\nThis switch is decent overall, however I think TP-Link needs to do a better job of conveying this issue up front. True, they do state clearly you need a neutral wire, but frankly, how many DIYers know what that is?  They see black (or red) and white and think \"live and neutral\".\n\nNow, for me I knew that I did not have the neutral wire where I initially wanted to install this switch.  But I love TP-Link WiFi outlets so I really wanted to try this. I installed it in a part of my home which is newer and has the required neutral.  The installation is just as simple as any conventional switch.  The box includes the needed wire capes and a matching wall plate.  You can use this snap on plate for a very finished look, or use your exiting \"Decora\" plate.  I went with the included plate as it was new, so new looking, and had no screws, etc.\n\nUsing the Kasa app on my phone it was easy to set up the switch.  The issue I ran into is the switch would not always work manually, so I don't know if it was defective.  It did function fine by schedule or Alexa commands, but if we happened to press it, sometimes it was fine and sometimes we had to hit it 4-5 times, so I think it was mechanically defective.\n\nI give the concept a 5, the design a 3 because they do not account for the majority of homes which likely have just live/load/ground switches, and a 2 in my case because it had to go back, being defective.\n\n.", "summary": "Good Brand, Limited Installation (MUST Have Nuetral Wire), Mine was Defective", "unixReviewTime": 1529712000}

I tried them both, and this one is a little bit dimmer than the other, but it's not a major difference either way, and both served the purpose well. This bulb's globe is also a little bit shorter and skinnier, which made it easier to install and remove in that tight little space with my big dumb fingers. I ended up leaving the other slightly brighter and larger one in, because it didn't make much of a difference to me, and I didn't feel like swapping it back out. They were both worthy options.\n\nIf I had to choose only one, I'd probably go with this one, because even though it's a little dimmer it's still plenty of light, it's a little easier to install, and it's a little bit cheaper as a single bulb instead of a 2-pack. But you can't go wrong either way.\n\nI leave the light on all the time, and unlike the old short-lived incandescent versions, I'm hoping to get a very long life out of these.

The LED is on the cooler side of neutral, probably 5500k.  I ordered neutral white to avoid the green/blue output color which is normal with a cool white LED.  Just FYI this has a tint of green even with it being a neutral.  Youll only notice the touch of green on a wall.  Using it as I intend to do it won't show any green, its not that bad.\n\nThe battery tube is angled so don't think thats a defect.  The AA slides in just fine.\n\nThe output ramping is very quick and easy. I don't know why I thought this was unnecessary. Now Im reminded how much I couldn't stand preset levels when working in tight conditions.  There was never the right amount of light. The TH20 solves that problem completely. I won't be without this flexibility now.\n\nThe unit itself also can be adjusted up or down for good angles of light at infinite positions.\n\nIts got Instant turbo on (with  Li-ion), instant moonlight, and a Brightness level memory, even SOS is you're a nighttime bike rider,\n\nThe dimpled orange-peel reflector does a great job of spreading that light around. I didn't want a spotlight on my forehead and this has great flood. We can attribute that to the XPL LED. My old headlamp had and XR-E and they are too narrow of a beam you're always moving your head to light something up.\n\nAll of the above is so easy to do. None of this is any amount of hard work like I expected.  Some headlamps force you to hold buttons in to turn it off and on, or they have some tiny plastic button that you almost need to press with your finger nail.  The TH20 is super easy one clock or double click and you're good!\n\nComes with extra o-rings and and extra rubber head plate, which seems to hold it very well and is not uncomfortable, unlike plastic ones. It also holds the lamp away from your forehead so it won't get too hot.  I have not sweated in it yet, thats a true test of a headlamps strap.\n\nGreat purchase.

Since changing windows won't need too much screw, it serves me very well.\n\nI also bought a DelWalt 1/4\" interchangeable tool set.

And amazingly, after only one day, the tracking told me that my PS20 is on the way for delivery. I couldn't wait to see it at home. Amazon did a excellent job on delivery.\n\nBy the way, the one I ordered from Amazon is made in Malaysia, while the one I bought at Homedepot is made in Thailand.

Whoever cut the hole to install the sink didn't quite get the concept of oval, and put the faucet hole right up against the wood.  The lock-nuts are kind of wide at the top (almost like it's a washer and nut in one), so I didn't have enough room.  Being the middle of the night and the store was closed to find a smaller nut, I had to improvise and was able to sand down the width of the lip of the plastic-nut. (I'm happy to report, it's still holding.) And lastly, I am a bit bummed that I paid more at Home Depot in the clearance pile ($88), but that is irrelevant to the function of the faucet.

We don't have alot of room\nin our bathroom and nowhere to hang towels except over the shower stall, so these hooks worked perfect for what we need.\nThe hook actually has a tiny hook on the bigger part of the hook so it keeps the towels from falling off it alot better\nthen the small one did. Also you can hang 2 different things like the top and bottom of a wet bathing suit on it and it\ndoesnt fall on the floor. The hook doesnt take up alot of space, you could actually put quite a few of them side by side\nand still have room. This hook holds alot of weight, my daughter being the clumsiest kid on the planet dropped her towel\nin the shower when it was on and then she just grabbed it and stuck it on the hook and i was terrified it was going to\nrip right off the wall but it held and we haven't had any problems with it coming loose. I love the smaller and bigger\nversions of this that i have on my wall, i use the smaller one for my towel and my daughter gets this one because its\nalot more heavy duty.

Instructions were generally straight forward, but would recommend going thru all of it before actually assembling the saw. Because of the 52 rails, some assembly needed to be removed to install rail components. Not a big deal, but added time to the entire assembly.\n\nNow to the operation, saw was pretty set, right out of the box, with some minor tweeking.needed for fence. Powerful and quiet the best way describe the beast, I do a lot of ripping on 4/4 red oak and have had very little saw related issues. Fence remained dead on and repeatable cuts have not been a problem. Dust collection is fair, I have a steel city DC 1200 cfm connected but still I get a lot under the saw. Just recently (still waiting for shipment) invested in a true cut system to replace the stock one, never could get it to sit right...and with the addition of a Incra 5000, makes cross cuts a snap.\n\nAll in all, the saw was a good deal for the money spent, a year and 5-600 b/f of oak later, it might have been better to bite the bullet and get a cabinet saw, but what the heck, I can get another couple of years out of this one before looking for a replacement.", "summary": "After a Year owning the saw", "unixReviewTime": 1209859200}

I want to first point out something I didn't notice until I gave up on this & decided to move it to a room where function wasn't so critical, due to not so great performance. On the unit, there is a range switch. Mine was set to lowest setting, but I didn't see it or know of it until I got fed up w/ it & went to move it. With the range set higher, now works better for coming on in the 1st place, but still have some issues w/ it not detecting that I'm still in the room. Some of these sensors work different ways, I'm not sure, but I do think it's supposed to know you're there w/o having to do the jive every now n then. Anyway, it still does go off on me when I'm still there, but seems to work better in that regard also now that range set to max.\n\nAnother issue is that for all of my outlets/surge protectors, etc...the main 3-prong plug-in unit is upside-down, so no matter what, you're covering 2 outlets & only getting one back. I used this on a lamp in my office-has 2 entries but 1 wall switch/light. I always enter thru the way w/ no switch. This was an OK solution, but light kept going out on me after a while in middle of work & it was harder to get back on than it should've be-doin' a wavy hand dance 1\" from the sensor still took several seconds for it to come back on. A bit easier to reactivate now w/ range on high also, but still gotta wave at it once it cuts off. I haven't tried it back in the ofc. since changing the range, mainly cuz I got another solution there. It does work better now, but haven't exposed myself to it enuf to know how much better.\n\nWhat I like about this-sensor can be wall-mounted w/ 2 small screws (or double-sided tape) not included if I recall, but has mounting holes for it-or it comes with a little desk/shelf stand. The concept is great, but execution- needs improvement. Also a negative-for me, the reach of the cord to the sensor is too short, unless you do wall-mount (even then maybe more cord preferred). I think a wall-mount in combo w/ a stick-on cord manager would make a clean look, on a budget & less time than alternative. Works well enough to get you in the room, would suggest having a 2nd light source for those pesky cut-offs though.\n\nAnother con-this comes on day or night. I just turn sensor towards the wall in the day. I solved the office issue w/ a small battery powered motion sensor LED light mounted to the wall (see other review for that product) which doesn't give off nearly as much light, but works for me to see where to step & turn on my desk lamp. The battery pwr LED's have a daylight sensor & only come on in the dark. I have no idea why, but the small motion sensors on those little $7.64 LED lights work incredibly well. So well, I know they're there but they still startle me sometimes! They were mis-advertised as being larger than they are, so originally bought them for main outdoor lighting, but they come in so handy everywhere, I kept them for other uses like this.\n\nTo me, the best solution would be to replace the wall switch with a quality motion-sensor switch (hard-wired), that detects presense by heat and movement, or just heat-something to keep it on no matter what, while you're there. But, the corded version is much less labor/ time/ money, so I feel OK about the purchase. It served my needs well enough & long enough & is still useful in another spot.\n\nIf not for the issues I mentioned, I would have given 5-stars.", "summary": "Great concept, needs improvement.", "unixReviewTime": 1406937600}

The blade angles are such that you can not easily get under the old paint and push the old paint off.  Drag and scrape backward, yes; push, no.  The blade angle from the handle is about 120-125 degrees.  It should be a lot closer to 180 degrees to allow you to have the heat gun in one hand and the tool in the other and push the tool under the old paint immediately after the old paint is heated.  To remedy this, I put the blades into vise grips or channel locks which allows you to have the blade at a lower angle to the old paint.\n\nAlso, the tool does come with a variety of blade shapes but to change the blades and keep them tight you need a screw driver handy. Instead of a bolt with a flat head the tool should have a wing nut that you can open and tighten with your hand.  As soon as I find a wing nut that fits the opening, I will replace the existing bolt with the wing nut. But if you keep the blades handy, you can use the side of one of the blades to tighten or remove the bolt.  A wing nut would be a whole lot better.\n\nFinally, I congratulate the designer for recessing the sharpening file into the handle with a magnet.  The file also has a curved side to sharpen the curved blades.  Obviously, this file is intended only for a quick fix, however. A filing stone is needed for long term use, as does all similar tools with blades like this.\n\nUPDATE October 7, 2013.  I'm updating my review now that I have worked with--or I should say, attempted to work with--this tool on a big project.  I'm lowering my rating from two stars to one star. First the variety of profiles on the blades is excellent.  You get a total of 12 different profiles. For that they should get five stars.  The problem is as I said originally, and have now experienced on a big job, the design is extremely poor. The one angle that this tool gives you is not at all sufficient for most jobs.  Woodwork has all sorts of nooks and crannies at all sorts of angles.  For that you have to attack the nooks and crannies with tools and blades at all sorts of angles.  You can not do that with this tool. You get your one 120 degree or so angle and that's it.\n\nFurther, as Chris K commented to my original review, it is better to pull than to push when using a heat gun.  I agree.  But the further problem I discovered when trying to pull with this Allway tool is that you have to put the heat gun UNDER the tool when the tool is in effect in a closed position.  You simply can not get the heat gun aimed at the paint when the tool is in the way of the heat gun. Something has to give.  You either heat the area and hope after getting the Allway tool out of the way that the paint will remain sufficiently plyable and soft you will be able to lift the paint easily and quickly.  You simply can not work at a consistent pace with this tool with a heat gun.\n\nBut worse, and this is something I would not have believed until I experienced it,  is that the bottom portion of the toll where the blade rests in the tool is made out of PLASTIC!!!  This means when you aim the heat gun under the tool as close to the blade as possible you are MELTING the tool!!!\n\nStill worse is the fact that you can only use one profile at a time and have to go thru the trouble of changing profiles in the midst of a job that may require many different profiles repeating over each other.  Each blade in the six blade set has two profiles on each end.  Problem is you can only use one at a time.\n\nI also have the Robert Larson Shavehook set with three blades.  I know there is a lot of criticism of that took with the posts being round and the holds for the blades being square and this apparently has caused for some swiveling of the blades.  I haven't had this problem.  Just keep in tight with a small wrench nearby. But the point I'm making is that the multiple profile blades available with the Allway Tool can be used with Larson tool and as a result you are not wedded to the one angle as you are with the Allway.  You can have any angle you desire in which you position the tool.  And, of course, the Larson is made out of all metal.  It won't melt like the Allway.  You will have to use wide metal washers above and below the Allway blades to secure the blades onto the Larson tool, but that is a minimal inconvenience.  In fact, I don't consider it an inconvenience, it just the way the tool works. Also, with the Larson post, you can turn the post to any profile on any side of the blade you wish at anytime.\n\nI now know why Allway offers a six pack of its tool at seemingly A discount volume price.  They want you to buy at least six because they knew you will go nuts trying to use just one.  It seems also that each tool in the six pack comes with the six blades (total 12 profiles.  That's a waste and needless expense.  If they are going to resort to this silliness, just sell six handles BUT MAKE SURE THE ARE MADE OUT OF ALL METAL SO THEY WON'T MELT WHEN USING THEM WITH A HEAT GUN!!!!\n\nHaving said all of this, seems that the two most important tools when stripping paint with a heat gun are an ice pick and a flexible putty knife.", "summary": "Bad angle.", "unixReviewTime": 1337558400}

We live in New England and the sun is low in the sky in December and we probably only get about 8 hours of direct sunlight on these every night,  but that has been enough to keep these lit all night,  every night.\n\nThere are some caveats as a result of the solar nature of these lights,  combined with the length an number of bulbs.\n\nFirst,  these are tiny bulbs. They do project evenly over a wide angle,  but they aren't particularly bright. They are bright enough to be easily seen from some distance at night,  but even with two strings on one leaf bare bush,  they don't cast much light on the ground.\n\nSecond,  the built in battery cannot provide full brightness in all modes. If you want all the lights on steadily,  you only get half brightness. If you want steady light at full brightness,  that mode only lights half the lights, (every other bulb). The best compromise seems to be to select a blinking/twinkling/cascading mode.\n\nThird,  while you can switch the lights off,  switching them on only activates the ambient light sensor. There is no power mode that forces the lights to light in a lit environment. There is also no timer mode. The light sensor works great for us as the solar panels/light sensor point away from our house and any street lights. We can turn our porch lights on with out these lights switching off. Others might have issues.\n\nNote: if you have trouble with these,  make sure to try the different modes.

ZT 's. Kershaws. Spyderco. ESEE. Ontario. These are what I stick with. I've had my Spyderco Endura for over 20 years. It's still solid. A true workhorse EDC. I've only recently started to acquire Spyderco knives. I got the Tenacious which I did with some hesitancy as it's made in China. I consider China knives as uncollectable. With that in mind, I'll put this knife through everything I can throw at it. Truth be told, it's a very well made knife. I was impressed. Now which Spyderco do I buy now? They make so many. I was ready to pull the trigger on the Endura 4. I love flat ground blades. At the last minute I see the Manix 2 in blue. As per usual, I search YouTube reviews along with Amazon's and any others I can. I loved the weight. 2.85 ozs? Really? I admit that I didn't care for the blue color at first but at the same time. Practically all\nmy knives are black! This translucent blue was cool.\n\nSo today I finally get my Manix 2. You know how it is. You simply can't WAIT to see the UPS truck pull up (and hope wifey doesn't see). I open the box up and even though I was expecting light, was really surprised at HOW light it is! You'd think it'd be blade heavy but it's balanced superbly. Just a delight.\n\nAt first I felt the action was a tad stiff to deploy the blade one handed with ease. After using the Kershaw Blur, you tend to get spoiled. But, Spyderco has thoughtfully placed Torx screws that allow adjustment of the pivot tension. I adjusted both sides by loosening them perhaps 1/8 of a turn. Maybe less. That did it! A very small amount of RemLube on all parts and now it flicks open nicely with one hand. Be careful doing this if you must. Check to see if you've allowed the blade to have any play in it. Mine has zero.\n\nThe sharpness of this blade wasn't exactly razor like. That's ok though. I like being able to place my own finishing on a knife blade. Sharpened up excellent. I don't need to shave my arm hair to convince me. It's perfect. It was a great day today and I wore my sweat pants. Put this knife in my pocket. Clipped on nice. Love the clip BTW. Even with sweats, the knife felt like it was there. Not many good folders with an almost 3.5 inch blade can do that!!\n\nIn summary:\n\nSurprising weight.\nBeautiful design/color\nGreat clip.\nExcellent steel. Easily sharpened.\nBeautiful lockup and action.\nGreat value overall.\n\nSpyderco nailed this one. I'd like too see more colors.\n\nLooks like I'm in trouble. I'll be buying a lot\nmore USA made Spyderco knives. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.", "summary": "Everything they said and more", "unixReviewTime": 1397088000}

Vertical  swithch in this unit is great, but I have a feeling I'll be changing the float and the switch within 5 years at most.\n\nInstructions on the internet how to do this are available, the float is 35 bucks on amazon, the switch is 20. So not a big deal, I ordered this unit knowing all this from the reviews.\n\nGuess I'm spoiled by having 3 regular sump pumps, 1 lasted 7 years, the other 2 are 10 years old and still working, so I believe the Wayne motor may last 10 years, but maintenance on the float  and swithch sort of sucks, but any vertical float switch may not last as long as the older floats, idk\n\nAt least with the Wayne unit you can replace the float and swithch more easily then your standard pump.\n\nThis pump is great, but will be a long time in trusting this unit to last, I will update as time goes by.\n\nMy sump pump pit is large, so a regular float be fine by me, but none are available at this high horsepower with good ratings, so trying the vertical model, and hope for the best, if I do order a second pump, I will order the float assembly and swithch, I figure out of 2 of these units I will be changing one or the other within 5 years or less, so I'll have my 2 older sump pumps ready just in case, and keep the parts on hand instead of waiting to order them when needed,  we will see\n\nAll research on the internet has Wayne pumps one of the highest, and most affordable compare to zoeller pumps, 3 times price wise of this Wayne pump for a 1 hp.\n\nTime will tell, love the pump, just not really confident in getting 5 years out of it without replacing the float or switch, and the 5 year warranty from reading their manual sounds like it will be tougher to get the unit fixed if needed, but just my gut feeling on this.\n\nI'm not using pvc pipes, never have, I use the black hose to be flexible when needed, makes it easy to change out the pump when needed,. I bought the check valve but didn't use it, it's made for pvc pipe, not the black flexible hose I use, no biggie, I like the water flushing back in, helps clean out any  debris that may try to clog the unit.\n\nAlso I'm using a heavy duty 3 pronged extension cord even though the manual suggest not too, the cord is only 7 feet or so long, I've used it on my other sump pumps much cheaper, so Wayne has to suck it up and work with a heavy extension cord, so far so good, next flood I can tell better when unit runs for 30 mins or so non stop.\n\nSo I say this Wayne unit for the price cant beat it, but must be willing to change float or swithch when needed. Unless you just buy a new one, much cheaper to replace the parts.\n\nJust wish Wayne had more confidence in their product so I could be,\n\n5 stars until I see any reason to change it, giving Wayne the benefit of the doubt, as far as noise, very quiet pump, I checked the screws on the unit to insure they were tight, all were. Seems heavy but not overly too much, I don't care if the body rusts a bit, sure it will be surface rust only, not affecting the units functioning.\n\nI helped myself by capping both of my drains in basement and crawl space, as all went into the yard inside the ground, every flood water came rushing into my house because of this, now water comes in during a flood still but much slower, so 2 sump pumps are for my piece of mind in case we get a major flood like last year, 18 inches of water in my basement, 1200 dollars to repair my furnace, lucky my hot water tank survived, its an 80 gallon beast for my jetted spa bathtub.\n\nSo investing in Wayne to prevent this damage next major flood, lived in my house 20 years and last years flood was the worst of my 56 years on this planet, scared me straight, so more power now, hate floods but curious if we get another major flood how this pump will keep up running for 3 hours straight as my other ones had to, that will be the true test.\n\nMother Nature can be nasty, but hopefully Wayne's helps even the odds next battle, I'll update again when I got more to add, I will order another for my second pit soon, starting to gain confidence in the pump, ty gl", "summary": "Great pump, just makes me nervous", "unixReviewTime": 1501804800}

Over Christmas I bought 3 additional kits at one sale for $24.99 each, so now I have 4 drills, 4 chargers and 4 batteries for less than the price of 2 extra batteries alone as sold here.\n\nBy the way, if your a bit handy and and can solder well you can buy raw cells for these battery packs.  You'll need to have a good quality soldering station with tempature control and a fine tip. Go to batteries.com or any of the many vendors selling the individual cells, the kind you want are 18560, 3.7 volts at around 3000 mh.  The cost is between 3$ & 5$ per cell and you'll need three to completely rebuild the pack.  Take out the 4 screws and open the pack. Carefully unsolder the electronics board from the batteries and measure the voltage on each of the 18560 cells, you'll probably find only one is below 3 volts and the other 2 will likely be about 3.6 volts, these are still usable if you want.  So if you're handy and your soldering skills are good then you can save a ton of money by doing the rebuild yourself, and in any case, it doesn't cost anything to try.", "summary": "Good drill but a silly price for the batteries", "unixReviewTime": 1488153600}

The minor things are that the trigger could be a little larger, which would help with gloved hands.  Similar saws I have used have two finger wide triggers, and it makes a difference.  I don't know why Dewalt didn't include a max speed control.  Cutting metal with this could be a pain to keep the blade running slow.  The trigger controls the speed, but there is no dial for the maximum speed.  Not nice.  But here's the biggie:  Let me preface by saying that I am a big guy.  Huge.  But this saw vibrates so much that my forearm hurt after 3 to 4 minutes of playing with it. (Just to compare, I tried my Skill brand 110V (don't laugh, cost me $39) powered recip saw, and it is easily 1/10 the perceived vibration.) I have run rotary drills, hammer drills, and demo jack hammers with less vibration.  I didn't have gloves on.  It vibrated my arms and shoulder so much that my glasses slid down.  I don't see anyone grabbing this saw to trim brush and tree limbs, which I thought would be an advantage of a cordless recip saw.\nDeWalt, get your kinematics people to address the vibration.\n\nSo to summarize, in order of importance: excessive even extreme vibration, no max speed control, and trigger size.", "summary": "The manufacturing and fit and finish of the saw seems just fine.

It doesn't need to be manually paired to the device to work, so you won't find it on your list of Bluetooth devices. If you select a wall in the app, then click the Laser button, it will find and show your laser measure and allow you to connect to it. After that, it holds that connection through the rest of the session. This is in the help section of the app.\n\nThe software they are using is a branded version of Magic Plan. Luckily, the non-branded version of Magic Plan can be used with the Stanley laser, so no need to use a special version of it. I generally avoid branded versions of software. They tend to be backlevel, and have less support than the original version.\n\nAs far as construction goes, it is equivalent to my more expensive Disto unit. Still, I was hoping it would have a more robust feel. It may not survive on a job site, though these devices tend to be used by real estate agents after the house is built, rather than during. Just don't drop it, and you'll be fine.\n\nThe Magic Plan app is much, much better than the almost laughable app that the Disto comes with. That one is not easy to use, does very little, and allows you to save the floorplan in only one format, a picture. Yes, you read that correctly. A picture, and it puts it right in the picture gallery with the other thousand or so pictures you've already taken. This one will do all the major formats, but costs $3 per plan. If you are using this for personal use, like I am, that is $3 well spent. For professionals, they have monthly subscription plans.\n\nSo, Magic Plan is pretty great, though there is definitely a learning curve, because it is powerful. It gets even better, however. Magic Plan works with Floorplanner, which is a web-based system for drawing floor plans and decorating. So, you can create the plan for your home with Magic Plan, then use Floorplanner to put in furniture and create 3D renderings of your rooms. There is a cost for this, but it is $5 for a single project, which means that if you are just doing your own home, it is $5 and you are done. Annoying, perhaps, but again, money well-spent.\n\nThe device itself is easy to spot due to its yellow jacket color scheme. It has a rubberized grip to make it less likely you will drop it. And you won't want to, because my feeling is that this isn't going to survive much of a drop. It is lightweight, which is good, but it isn't rugged like a piece of construction equipment. It is easy to use its most basic function, which is to measure the distance to an object, most commonly, a wall. According to the packaging, it can do volume calculations, presumably by measuring ceiling heights and factoring that in. It is easy to get the ceiling height - just place it on the floor aimed up, and press the measurement button. How to do the volume stuff? Well, it is in the manual. I wasn't interested in that because it really isn't useful for me. If I were sizing rooms for HVAC vents or something, it might be somewhat useful. After you have the measurements, though, doing simple calculations like volume isn't difficult, so I really doubt these additional features beyond measurement and bluetooth capability, are used much, by anyone.\n\nPersonally, I think this is a great alternative to the Disto. However, the Disto is very, very common in the real estate profession, so if you are planning on using this with a particular piece of software, you'll want to see if it supports the Stanley before buying. Disto support can practically be assumed because of its popularity. The Stanley? Not so much.\n\nOverall, recommended. Especially if you are using this for personal use, and are only doing one or two houses with it.\n\nSean Logue, 2015", "summary": "Where we are going, we won't need wheels!", "unixReviewTime": 1448668800}

The Wooster Brush Sherlock GT pole is a well-designed tool. It has a light weight, fiberglass outer sleeve and a hexagonal, aluminum inner pole.  That combination results in a stiff, light weight assembly and the inner pole will not turn inside the sleeve.\n\nThe features that really set it apart from the typical extension pole are the click-to-set extension length and the bayonet tool attachment.  Setting the length with the push of a button means that you will adjust the length more frequently to obtain the optimum length because it's just so easy!  Granted, the length is adjustable only in 6\" increments, but that's really no problem at all.  Once you experience the Sherlock GT system, you'll never to back to a twist-lock and screw-on roller extension!\n\nBeing able to install and uninstall a brush, tool or roller with a button push means that you can dip the brush or apply paint to the roller without the cumbersome extension attached.  Makes for a much neater, easier and quicker application of paint.\n\nI found that I could use the pole with a roller attached at any extension length.  Guiding a 16' pole with a roller is a handful, but the Wooster Sherlock GT did it as well as could be expected, with minimum bending and no twisting of either the lock or the tool.\n\nI also used the Wooster Sherlock GT with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mr-Longarm-Brush-Tool-Holder-Extsn-Kit-0650/dp/B00004YUPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mr Longarm Brush/Tool Holder Extsn Kit 0650</a>&nbsp;to cut in ceiling lines with mixed results.  The Wooster Sherlock GT did its job perfectly.  The limitation is mainly in the ability of the painter to see the line clearly enough to do a satisfactory job.  I found that I could work a line no more than 4' to 6' above my head before I reached the limit of my 20-15 vision.\n\nPros: Relatively light weight.  Very stiff; minimal bending.  No slipping or rotation of extension.  Quick on and off of tools and rollers.\n\nCon: Nothing I can think of. The 8' - 16' model is a lot of pole to handle, so remember that when you are choosing the length (shorter models available).", "summary": "The Best Extension Pole", "unixReviewTime": 1365379200}

Overall has a quality \"look and feel\" of a more expensive unit.\nBox was very sturdy, and had a number of cardboard supports to isolate the saw in the box, but the cardboard under the saw wasn't overly thick, and a number of reviewers reported broken feet, likely due to rough handling somewhere along the line.  My saw had all four feet in good condition.\n\"Instructions\" are in Japenglish with postage stamp \"illustrations\" showing assembly \"details\", but there aren't too many ways to put it together, so anyone with basic mechanical skill should be able to assemble it easily.  It took me less than a half hour from opening the box to doing test cuts. YouTube videos can assist with any assembly problems.\nWhen \"folded\" at 45 deg miter and 45 deg bevel, the saw is compact, saves space in my garage/shop, and is light enough to be easily trans-portable for storage or use elsewhere.\nOut of the box, the blade was set at a perfect 90 degrees both vertically and horizontally\nThe thumb indexing for the preset stops is easy and intuitive, and is made of spring steel that will be less prone to breakage than the plastic versions on some other saws.  For off-index angles, the large table handle is threaded to press the indexing spring against the table to hold the saw in place.\nThe saw has a large pin behind the motor that inserts into a deep hole in the saw body to lock the saw up, and temporarily will hold the saw down when inserted into a shallower hole in the saw body.\nA \"T\" socket wrench and hex wrench are attached in a rubber holder to the top of the saw for changing the blade and making adjustments\nThe saw handles small pieces easily, but because of its light weight it moves easily, so I will likely bolt it to a plywood base that can be clamped to a work table for handling larger items.\nOperation is so easy a cave man could do it - plug it in, place the work piece on the table (hold or clamp in place), stay away from the moving parts, pull the trigger, let the saw spin up to speed and move it down slowly thru the piece... The ergonomics of the saw handle and trigger are very comfortable.\nI purchased a 100 tooth blade for crosscutting and \"finer work\" but the 24 tooth blade that was installed cut smoothly and made a true 90 degree cut.\nThe laser works OK indoors, but might be a bit weak in bright sunlight\nPROS\nPrice\nDesign and construction\nIndexing system\n\"Off index\" securing handle\n\"T\" wrench and hex wrench attached to the saw\nLaser\nCONS\nInstruction book is all but useless, but basic mechanical skill and YouTube are your friends!\n\nSo far, a great value single bevel saw.", "summary": "Great value saw!", "unixReviewTime": 1491264000}

He had a whetstone but it was looking pretty bad so he bought a metal stone and didn't like that at all.  He likes this one because of it's size and quality.  He said that with the angle of the stone it makes it so easy to use.  Does it sharpen well?  Yes! My kitchen knives are sharper now than they were when I bought them actually.  I was threatening to go buy all new knives because mine were beyond dull and dangerous to use.  He had sharpened them a couple of months ago with his metal sharpening tool but they didn't sharpen much.  After using this whetstone I will now not have to go and buy a new set.  The stone itself is just a little over 4 inches long and 1 and half inches wide.  It's the perfect size to sharpened just about any knife you own. The plastic case it is on makes it even easier to use, the stone doesn't slip around so you don't run such a big risk of cutting yourself.  I'm impressed because my husband loves it and he is a very picky man when it comes to his knives.  I will come back and update this review in a couple of months to reflect how well the stone is holding up to normal use.  It is getting an honest workout because not only has my husband sharpened all our knives but has begged others to allow him to sharpen theirs too.

The 2 prong adaptors are good for non-grounded applications such as most battery chargers for camera batteries.  The 2 prong adaptors can be plugged into most if not all grounded plugs in Italy.\n\nI recommend both types of adaptors if you are going to Italy and need grounded plugs for some of your applications.

My big question was, \"What is best number of digits to use and how many different combinations can be created since it does not matter what order the numbers are pressed? For example, the code 1,2,3 would open the lock whether you pressed 1,2,3 - 3,2,1 or 2,1,3. The order does not matter, only the numbers. If you set all 10 numbers and pressed all of the numbers the lock would open because the order does not matter. So I wondered how secure would the lock be and what are the optimum number of digits to use to make the lock the most secure?\n\nI found a website that calculates the possibilities WITHOUT taking into account the number of permutations. Below are the possible combinations based on the number of digits used.\n1=10, 2=45, 3=120, 4=210, 5=252, 6=210, 7=120, 8=45, 9=10, 10=1\n\nThis may help you decide how many digits to use for maximum security. The obvious answer is 4 or 5. Four is easier to remember but 5 gives you the maximum security.\n\nI hope this helps someone to decide how many digits to use. I will update this review when I've installed the lock but this information is something that you need before you set your combination.\n\nI chose 4 stars because although the lock seems to be super sturdy and reliable, a maximum of 252 codes is not the highest security. Trying a code every five seconds would allow me to crack the lock in less than 30 minutes but for practical non super high security use it should work fine.", "summary": "How many numbers or digits should you use?", "unixReviewTime": 1417132800}

I was expecting that the better color rendition would be responsible for the difference but there is another factor.  Comparing side by side the color actually looks about the same to me, but the indoor sunshine bulb looked more stable which made me feel relaxed.  Looking at their website, they claim the ballast on these bulbs operates at 50,000 cycles per second which is very fast.  I believe this is responsible for the perceived stability and I would bet that the typical CFL is running much lower.\n\nOverall it doesn't beat the light quality that is offered by certain Xenon M16's and perhaps a select few LED's such as the Soraa also in MR16.

Although the light is small and unobtrusive, it puts out quite a bit of light - no problems at all seeing who is at the door when the light is on high.\n\nI like that it is solar powered since it makes installation very flexible. Just make sure it gets some sunlight during the day, and you're good to go.\n\nIt has two operating modes. It runs in \"low\" mode when it gets dark, which shines just a small amount of light. About the same as a low-wattage night light. However, when the sensor is triggered by movement, it switches to high power. That puts out more than enough light to read by, and easily lights up my front steps.\n\nIMPORTANT: the light comes out of the box in \"off\" mode. You have to insert a supplied key (sort of looks like an unbent paper clip) into a small hole on the front to get it to turn on. That's done, according to the manual, to keep the light from operating when it's being shipped. There's also a plastic film that needs to be removed from the top of the solar panel. So, if you think the light is dead on arrival, don't forget to check that you've done those two steps!\n\nThe build quality is nice. Nothing fancy, but it has a sturdy aluminum bracket. The light lens is plastic. The colors (white and silver) blend well with pretty much any color scheme.\n\nVery pleased with this, and highly recommend it as a front door security light.\n\n[Manufacturer provided the product for review]", "summary": "Excellent security light for the front door", "unixReviewTime": 1362009600}

The steel flange also has the stainless steel toilet mounting studs already attached in the proper position, which make lining up your toilet that much easier.  The steel flange needs to be oriented correctly for the flange to line up correctly with the toilet and the flange is stamped with the word \"BACK\" on it so you shouldn't have a problem.  The kit comes with mounting hardware (four 1-1/2\" screws) to accommodate the installation of the flange to the floor and washers and nuts to be used to attach the toilet to the flange.  You still need to purchase a wax ring(s) to seal the flange kit to your old toilet flange, if your bathroom floor has been built up with new flooring and your current flange is below the floor surface level, you may need to use two wax seals to achieve a good seal.\nThe nice thing about this kit is you don't need to use another wax ring to make a seal between the toilet and the Danco Flange repair kit, because of the built in neoprene rubber seal.  This allows you to remove and reinstall the toilet in the future without having to deal with the messy wax rings anymore.\nAfter installing this kit, the toilet seems more stable and doesn't wobble at all and best of all the installation appears to be leak free!  I would recommend this flange repair kit to anyone that has a broken/damaged toilet flange, a flange that is recessed below floor level, or toilet that wobbles due to a loose plumbing flange.  If your toilet has been leaking for quite some time and the floor has become rotted, you'll need to replace the rotted wood first, because the flange repair kit needs to be mounted securely to the floor for it to work properly.", "summary": "Danco 10672 HydroSeat Toilet Flange repair kit.", "unixReviewTime": 1419033600}

Regardless of the name, they all seem to do pretty much the same. The exception with these over my Etekcity, and more recent purchase of Beastron brand at two for $15.95 is this. The lights themselves are identical in style and brightness or lumens, and use the same type double A batteries, 3 each.  This 6 pack comes without batteries. But they have two features the others don't. One, a magnetic bottom, and two a hook on the bottom that flips out for hanging the lantern. And the three magnets on the bottom are strong enough to hold this lantern to any metallic object quite well. So it's a matter of economics ($6.16 per)  and features as to whether you determine this to be a value. You'll need 18 Double A (AA) batteries from the start. On top of the cost of the lantern. But the new features give you some additional ways in using these lanterns. Which in my opinion makes them a good buy. I would recommend using good alkaline batteries. And on that subject, although I have always used Coppertops. I tried Amazon Basics batteries which are by far cheaper. Although the shelf life isn't as long, they seem to work quite well. So you may take that into consideration as well. But I can definitely recommend this lantern. They are very bright. The more you pull the lantern up from the casing, the brighter the light.

Connected with thin, clear sheathed wire (~20-22 gauge). Nothing is replaceable or disconnectable but the batteries. No searching for that one bad bulb that keeps everything from working (like those Christmas lights).\n\nI tested out how long the batteries last by inserting 3 rechargeable batteries. After a week they were still glowing. I'd expect alkaline batteries to slowly start to dim after a few days of constant use, where rechargeables usually die quickly when they run down.\n\nThere is a switch that lets you set them for off, on, or flashing (or more like seizure inducing).\n\nThe description clearly indicates these lights are not waterproof. However, if you got caught in a brief or light rain, they'd likely survive. You could also, with a bit of effort and a tube of silicone, seal each globe and put the battery pack in a Zip-loc bag and make these light very weather resistant. At least they're honest and don't claim to be waterproof as long as you don't expose them to water.\n\nInserting the batteries the first time can be tricky. But once you figure out how the top slides off, it's no problem.\n\nThese are not expensive appearing lights. There are no mold seams on the globes. But each has a collar into which the bulbs are pressed with a drop of glue. For the price though, they're quite a nice value. With a little ingenuity, you can find lots of uses beyond just a string of lights with a bulb every 4\".\n\nSo, why not 5 stars?  As a longtime Amazon shopper, I've come to distrust any review with a 5 star rating that contains the words 'free sample' or 'honest and unbiased', and disregard them. So, think 4 1/2 stars, rounded down.\n\nThanks for reading.", "summary": "A safe, efficient string of lights", "unixReviewTime": 1454889600}

I get that most people don't want that, especially when they might be entertaining guests, and then there is also the potential staining, I get why you did it, but again, it's a personal issue.\n\nNOTES:\nThis thing is an additive, so the thing that it's adding too determines how well it works.

I was dissatisfied with the light cast by the floodlight located in the recessed can above the wash basin.  After trying four different floodlight bulbs, I came to the following conclusions.\n\n[1]  Dispersion angle of the light beam is very important\n\nIn my opinion, my bathroom looks much better when the beam dispersion angle of the floodlight leaves the walls above waist level in relatively low light, and the wall sections below waist level in a relatively bright light. In the case of my bathroom, I found that the ideal beam angle to achieve this would be about 70 degrees (see Footnote 2 for the method to calculate beam angle).\n\nThe beam angles of the lights I tried are as follows:\n\n== Polaroid (the light reviewed here):  About 65 degrees by my calculation\n\n== Bioluz LED Br40 Smooth 17w 2700k 1400 Lumens --  110 degree angle, manufacturer's calculation.\n\n== Philips model 429035, 3000K, 1200 lumens  .  25 degree angle stated in Amazon ad\n\n== G7  Power Vegas BR40  .  180 degree beam angle.\n\nUnfortunately, many manufacturers neglect to state beam angle.\n\n[2] Lumens\n\nI found that between 1200 and 1600 lumens gave pretty bright light.\n\n[3] Kelvin color temperature\n\nLight with Kelvin color temperatures between 2,700K and 3,000K is considered to be \"warm\".  Warm is more flattering to humans, and more pleasant.  I found that temps between 2700K and 3000K worked well for me. Quite possibly a bit higher up to 4000K would also work. See Wikipedia for discussion.\n\n[4] The recessed overhead light does not properly illuminate the face of someone using the bathroom mirror.  To accomplish this, we installed an actor's style array of lights around the edges of the mirror.\n\n/------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFOOTNOTE 1: PROS AND CONS OF POLAROID FLOODLIGHT\n\nPROS:\n\n(a) it is bright with 1600 lumens ;\n\n(b) has a beam dispersion angle that is better for my purposes of illuminating my 5' x 8' bathroom\n\n(c) has the best guarantee I have seen, 15 years;\n\n(d) very important for my purposes, it has ventilation slots surrounding the light source, so that the exhaust fan which is part of the light fixture can draw more air out of the room (none of the other three bulbs I tested had this type of ventilation slot);\n\n(e) it is rated as suitable for damp locations, which is exactly where the lamp will be located, in a recess in my bathroom ceiling.\n\nCONS\n\nNone that I have yet identified.\n\n/-------------------------------------\n\nFOOTNOTE 2:  If you want the brightest part of the beam to cover the wall below waist height (about 30\"), do the following measurements to find the correct beam angle: [a] Measure the distance between ceiling and waist height, and call it D1. So with a ceiling 96\" from the floor, D1 will be 96\"-30\" or 66\" (I assume a waist height of 30\"). [b] Then measure the distance between the center of the light and the furthest wall, and call it D2.  [c] Then construct on graph paper a right angle triangle where D1 is the perpendicular side, and D2 is the side horizontal to the ground.  Then use a protractor to measure the angle at the top vertex of the triangle. And multiply that angle by two.  If you remember your trigonometry, you can do it that way too.", "summary": "Best floodlight out of 4 that I tried", "unixReviewTime": 1406246400}

Basically what I was looking for is a knife that has the following:\n\nOne hand open/closing blade\nsaw\nScissors\nBottle/Can Openers\nFlat and Phillips screw drivers\nBelt Clip\nLanyard loop\nLess than 4inches closed\n\nAfter searching and searching, I realized that my dream knife didn't exist. SO I had to compromise. This was my compromise. It doesn't have the scissors, belt clip and is not less than 4 inches closed, but it does have Saw, Bottle/Can opener, lanyard loop and the screwdrivers so it's not a bad compromise. My problem with the knife is the engineering of it. The thumb lock-release for the main blade is designed for a left handed user. I knew this before I purchased, but I didn't think it was going to be that much of an issue. Sadly, I was wrong. The lock requires an immense amount of force which intern gives me a blister on thumb. Surely I could put the knife in my left hand, but if I had two free hands I wouldn't need the one handed open and close. The most aggravating part of this is, is that there is plenty of room to put the lock on the other side and just move the knife. It would seem that the only reason they did this was so that the bottle opener/flat blade screw driver could lock, which in my opinion is stupid since the Phillips driver doesn't lock. My other gripe is that the knife is huge in my hands. I am 5'10\", 180lbs, and I have what most glove makers would say medium sized hands and this thing feels like a mini K-bar knife in my hand. Though this is easy to look past, what is not easy to look past is that I intended this to be a Every Day Carry (EDC) Knife but if I put this in the same pocket as my keys I have no room for anything else, and since there is no belt clip, it MUST go in my pocket or dangled on my hip like a fish on a hook.\n\nThe things I do like and love about Victoronox knives this knife has though. The blade is a smooth and sharp and easy to resharpen, the construction feels very solid and the knife doesn't look like I'm trying to survive out in the wild for months. The scales are made of what feels like a composite ABS which I think is fantastic. And with all these combined I have no doubt that the knife will never fail me.\n\nWith all that said, I would not recommend this knife to someone searching for the same thing. I would recommend a Leatherman Wave (which I own) first because it is smaller and has all the features I was looking for. The only reason I wanted a new knife is that my leatherman is somewhat heavy to carry around and I wanted a cheaper knife in my pocket just in case I ever lose it. Other than that, it's a FANTASTIC knife.\n\nAnyways that is my review, as always you can ask me any questions you'd like I'll do my best to answer.

Even for the non-electrician.\n\nThis particular clamp meter has a very long list of functions and practical uses that will certainly be more than sufficient for the average user. A few things I particularly like about this meter are the dual display, its ability to test diodes, the temperature probe and its hold and maximum reading functions.\n\nI've had this multimeter for almost a month now, and as such I've tested most of its functions, and so far they are all working without issue. I really don't have any complaints about this multimeter, but if an issue arises or becomes apparent, I'll be sure to update this review.\n\nNow, while this certainly isn't the cheapest clamp meter out there, Amprobe is a quality brand, and this is a much better than average meter. It's well-designed and seems really well-made. It's function-rich, and as such it performs a LOT of tasks.

The Reactive Lighting Technology dims the light automatically when you get close to objects and does not waste light or battery power. I own both the NITECORE HC50 and HC90 headlamps. I love the Petzi Tikka RXP and the NITECORE headlamps equally. I would suggest the Petzi for light weight and comfort. You might forget the Petzi was placed on your head it is so comfortable; and the NITECORE(s), which are pretty comfortable as well, for power/maximum illumination.\nI am happy that these headlamp manufactures are producing quality, competitive, products that are durable, functional, and fun to own and talk about.\nAgain, do not forget to remove the clear plastic strip sandwiched between the battery and the bulb contacts! Otherwise, the light will not illuminate.", "summary": "Great Product, Thumbs Up!!", "unixReviewTime": 1454371200}

It runs on one AA battery (not included) and claims to be able to run continuously on one battery for 2 - 4 hours. That's all good!\n\nWhat sets this light apart from others is its strong magnetic end. You can (and we have) turn this light on and stick it under the hood of your car to shine down on wherever you need... like the radiator, to check the fluid level. I like that innovation a lot.\n\nWhat might be somewhat problematic is the way you turn this flashlight on and off; you screw the lens-end on tightly and, once tightened, the flashlight goes into always-on mode. When done using the flashlight, you unscrew the lens-end until the light goes off and it stays off. If being able to turn your flashlight on & off quickly and easily is not high on your priority list, then this is not an issue for you. Since it turns on in this manner, there are no alternate operating modes (no S.O.S, strobe, or low beam settings), just full-on 95 lumens or full-off dark.\n\nThat said, I do believe that this light produces the advertized 95 lumens as it is fairly bright, and the magnets worked exceedingly well in every place we tested it (under our Jeep's hood, on the refrigerator, etc...) Those are fairly big pluses, though their values needs to be weighed in comparison to the significant selling price.\n\nThis headlight unit comes packaged in a wonderful retail box, complete with foam inserts to protect it during shipping. It arrived in perfect condition; all we had to do was take it out of the box, put the battery in, and screw the lens tightly to turn it on.\n\nThe retail information states that this unit is covered by INGEAR's \"1 YEAR WARRANTY & 24/7 CUSTOMER SUPPORT!\", so if an issue arises during that period I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this LED flashlight gratis from the seller and put it to use to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.\n\nIf you are looking for a very portable flashlight of this style, size, 95 lumens power, on & off mechanism and price, for use similar to what I have described above, then this one works well and is quite small and bright, so it might be just what you are looking for.\n\nGo for it.", "summary": "INGEAR LED Flashlight - CREE Q3 95 Lumens - Sturdy - Magnetic end - Bright", "unixReviewTime": 1416614400}

I wasn't so sure about the cutout between the handle and the blade, but your first finger fits nicely there and stops the knife from slipping forward or back in your hand. For a knife without a guard or hilt, that can be important. It's relative short length is nice because you won't poke something when sitting down while it's still on your belt. There's a slight flex to the knife when intentionally checking for it, so the steel appears good to me. It's thick enough to not break unless used abusively. The feel in the hand is great. I have a medium hand. You can tell it would be easy to twist with and work well in whatever your cutting.  I'm sure I can use a lot of pressure and torque safely. The finish appears hard and will not scratch easily. I'm quite pleased with it and plan on using it for fishing.\nThe sheath is good enough, but I do plan on moving the strap down to where it will hold across the finger cutout. That should keep it from slipping too much and poking though the bottom, which this one shows signs of trying to do.\nI may get another just for a gift.

It is made of high quality material, looks and feels heavy duty and durable, its not flimsy at all like many other competitors. By comparing with my other ceiling recessed light fixtures, this LED light output is much brighter than CFL BR40 incandescent flood bulb.\n\nThis LED light turns on instantly to the max brightness level, not like my old CFL BR40 bulb which slowly reaches to the brightest level. When switching off this LED light, it turn off instantly, there is no afterglow. Also, this LED light is dimmable so it won't flicker or shutoff down or make buzz noise at low or high light level settings on your dimmer switch.\n\nThis LED retrofit module replaced my old CFL BR40 incandescent flood bulb. This recessed lighting kit fitted perfectly into 6 ceiling recessed lighting trim as you can see in attached picture. The kit comes with E26 base adapter so you don't have to rewire to connect new LED module, simply screw in the E26 adapter to the old light bulb socket then connect the adapter to the LED modular light connector.\n\nHere are simple and easy to follow Installation steps for anyone needing it:\n1. Turn off the power before installation\n2. Unscrew and take off the old bulb\n3. Remove the existing baffle trim\n4. Screw in the E26 socket adapter into the E26 socket,\n5. Connect the LED modular light connector to E26 adapter\n6. Turn the power on to test if LED light turns on. Turn off the power again to continue with next step\n7. Compress the spring clips on the LED light module and insert into the ears on the inside of the recessed can housing (see attached picture)\n8.  Push the LED light module into the recessed can housing until the trim is flush with the ceiling surface.\n\nI highly recommend these lights to anyone looking for a bright daylight LED replacement in the 5000k color range, just be aware that it is DAYLIGHT bright since so many of us are accustomed to a yellowish incandescent bulb.\n\nThe product arrived just as described, in a timely manner, was packaged perfectly, and in excellent condition.\n\nThis product was provided at a discounted price or free in exchange for my honest review. This is not a paid review. My opinions are entirely my own and in no way did the discounted price influence my review of this product.\n\n Please let me know by leaving a comment below if you found this review not helpful at all so I can assist you better or provide better details about the product.

With that attachment, which is sold separately, you can use it like a miniature reciprocating saw (Sawzall).  Just pop any \"T\" or \"U\" shaped jigsaw blade in, and you're in business.  I don't know of another tool that can be used in this way, and for that reason and that reason alone this Dremel is worth owning.\n\nI already own another multiple-speed Dremel, and I thought I'd sell it once I bought this.  But I'm keeping both because this new Dremel simply feels cheap and poorly made.  It seems like its plastic case is flimsier and it doesn't feel as balanced when it's operating.  It certainly isn't ergonomic.  Any Dremel user who buys this latest model will instantly notice the drop-off in quality.\n\nOn the good side, the multisaw attachment works well and the molded plastic case is designed to hold the Dremel, the multisaw and planer attachments, jigsaw blades, the included circle cutter and flex shaft.  The kit also includes two bit sets that lock onto the top of the case, with room for two more on the sides.\n\nThere's no way I can tell if this Dremel will last.  I've put a pretty good load on the motor, and it hasn't failed.  But I think that if I drop it more than a few feet onto a hard surface, it will break.  The shaft lock button feels particularly cheap and uncertain.  I expect it to break first.\n\nDespite all my concerns I'm keeping this Dremel.  But I'll only use it when I need the multisaw or planer attachment (the planer attachment must be purchased separately...it only comes with the higher-priced kit).  Any other time I'll use my other Dremel (model no. 3956-02).\n\nIt's extremely unfortunate that at the same time it has chosen to make the most versatile Dremel yet, the company also decided to cut corners on quality.

The disadvantage of such a system is that it distributes the dust in the air everywhere in the house. However, it is supposed to be possible to filter out the dust. Over the years, I have steadily increased the quality of the filter that I use for my forced air heating system. However, until now I have not noticed any obvious difference in my allergic reactions that seem to start with the heating season.\n\nThere are cats in my house. I have read that cat dander, tiny flakes of cat skin shed by the cats, is five times smaller than household dust particles. It stays in the air much longer than ordinary dust before it settles. Because of its small size it requires a more efficient filter to get it out of the air.\n\nUntil three years ago, I used of variety of filters with mixed results. However, then I started using the 3M Advanced Allergen Filters, the ones in the blue wrapper. These have a 3M Microparticle Performance Rating of 1500, and a MERV rating of 12.\n\nMERV stands for Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value produced from a test designed by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). A higher MERV rating indicates better filter performance.\n\n3M uses particle data between 0.3 and 1.0 micron size to calculate a Microparticle Performance Rating or MPR. The higher the MPR, the better the filter. However, higher rated filters cost more.\n\nHere are some of the Filtrete filters offered by 3M:\n\nDust & Pollen Filter, Microparticle Performance Rating 600,\nMERV rating of 8\nMicro Allergen Filter, Microparticle Performance Rating 1000,\nMERV rating of 11\nUltra Allergen Filter, Microparticle Performance Rating 1250,\nMERV rating of 11\nAdvanced Allergen Filter, Microparticle Performance Rating 1500,\nMERV rating of 12\nUltimate Allergen Filter, Microparticle Performance Rating 1900,\nMERV rating of 13.\n\nThe difference made by the Advanced filter was immediately obvious. My running nose stopped running. I assume that the new Advanced filters must be taking out more of the dust in the air including the cat dander. I have not noticed a change in the speed of the circulated air.\n\nMore recently, I have started using the newer Ultimate filter. It works better than the Advanced filter. The additional cost of the filter is worth it if you have allergies or pets. However, if you are happy with a lower-rated and lower-cost filter, then continue using that one.\n\nI suggest that you check Amazon and vendors on the web to get the best price.", "summary": "New and Improved", "unixReviewTime": 1299283200}

Most other crowfoots must actually be made from trained crows, and training crows must be expensive, because they always seem very expensive.  Imagine my delight when I saw these shiny things for only $14.  Heck, for 14 bucks they could be made out of glue and tissue paper and Id probably still buy them just to give them a try.  I bought both the SAE and Metric sets without hesitation.\n\nThey arrived very well polished, they look like the shiniest tools in my collection (maybe because they have so much flat surface area) and they come with your typical rail to hold them all together.  The first thing I wanted to do was try them out and see if under that fancy, shiny chrome plating was indeed pressed glue and tissue paper so I used them to take off a brake caliper mounting boltit worked like a charm.\n\nIt does drive me bonkers that it skips sizes.  Im convinced that some manufacturers like to say 10 piece socket set, sizes from 6mm to 34mm! and figure the buyer won't notice that there has to be some missing sizes in there somewhere.  But I digress, Im sure they have some marketing information and sales numbers to justify making sets that skip sizes, but it just makes my head hurt.  Like that guy on the Discovery Channel, I don't want to say it was aliensbut it was aliens.  The one star I took away was because of this.\n\nOverall, Im very pleased with my purchase.  I know these won't get used often, but when Im in that situation where a crowfoot makes the job so much easier, Ill smile.  And if the size I need is one thats not in this kit, Ill cry.\n\nFYIDid you know that the Corvidae bird family (which includes crows, magpies, and ravens) are the smartest birds in the world?

Some from Amazon, some from Ebay. All but one died within a month. Luckily I am an electrical engineer. After taking the lights apart I found that there was not a sufficient amount of thermal grease between the LED cluster and the base. Also, there should be 4 screws holding the LED in place. Some of my light fixtures only had 2. Another problem is that the holes that were drilled and tap'd for these 4 screws are not deep enough. The screws bottom out before they apply proper pressure on the LED. The major cause for these lights to keep failing is improper heat transfer. Excessive heat kills LED's every time.\nIf you go to Ebay, and do a search for \"100W White High Power LED Panel 9000LM 100 Watt Lamp Light\" you will find the actual LED clusters. Buy these. Only $8, what a deal!\nThen go get yourself some high quality thermal heat-sink grease. Remove the old LED cluster, and unsolder the wires. Clean off the old thermal grease. Without the LED in place, screw in the 4 screws to make sure they go all the way in without bottoming out. If they don't, either get shorter screws, or drill and tap deeper holes, and get new screws to match your new thread. Make sure both surfaces, (LED & Light base), are clean and smooth. Spread a thick layer of new thermal grease onto the LED and install with the 4 screws, nice and tight! Clean off excess thermal grease. Solder on the wires, (there is a + & - on the LED cluster), and you are finished. Really not that difficult.

Unfortunately this Kohler K-4986-7 Cachet Nightlight toilet is not one of them. The main issue is the hinge which also contains the light on the rear of the seat. It fails to remain secure to the seat. You can struggle  to get it in only to find that after one week or less it has disconnected to the toilet. I think personally this is a design flaw and the product was not tested long enough before it was marketed. The hinge on the rear of the seat is very tight in order to give the \"quiet close\" feature which prevents a slamming toilet seat and/or lid. Unfortunately this tight hinge \"fights\" the toilet brackets that hold the lid to the toilet itself with bolts. These brackets are flimsy plastic and they constantly come undone by simply snapping off when you move the seat up or down. The light was a great idea but who wants a toilet seat that is a hassle to keep on. Mine actually would come off and the light almost fell in the bowl water. Someone could actually get hurt if they sat on this when it was not connected and mine disconnected itself at least 15 times.\n I doubt this toilet  seat will be on the market in a years time because people are going to get hurt using this. Mine would be disconnected when I came home from work just laying on the rim unsecured. If you ever have guests using your bathroom are you going to warn them to be careful because that the toilet seat may come off ?What if you forget and they get hurt? This is not a worry you should have for a well made and well designed toilet seat which this is NOT.\nThe light is located in the rear of the seat in the moving hinge assembly. This is a terrible location for the light and is bound to fail and cause issues. In my opinion the light should have been located in the front of the seat and not part of the hinge in any way.\nThis is a product that you really can not evaluate until using it for a few weeks. Unfortunately many people write reviews within a day or two of receiving a product which in my opinion accounts for the numerous positive reviews for this flawed toilet seat. This toilet seat is really bad and after about a week, maybe two, you will realize that the nightlight is never going to last. The light will often become disconnected like the seat and once it falls into the bowl it is ruined and no good. Even if you avoid letting the night light fall into the bowl water it is still going to get wet. How are you going to clean the seat and toilet and keep moisture out of the nightlight? You can not unless you remove the light every time. It is guaranteed that the night light will get wet because the light assembly is not waterproof or watertight.\n Once your light no longer works why would you even buy this expensive toilet seat ? It is cheap plastic with really cheap plastic flimsy hinges and a night light that will fail you in a short time.\nNovelties can be fun such as a night light in your toilet seat. They can even be useful if they work. Once the novelty of this night light toilet seat wears off you realize you have an unsafe product that could injure a person and a light that is not designed to last very long.\nJust so readers know I am not the type of person who likes to return products. I looked at my purchase history with Amazon and saw that I have made one return in my past 100 purchases over 6 months. Toilet seats are not an item you normally want to return. However I was so bothered by the fact that Kohler( normally a company with great products) would market a toilet seat as flawed and dangerous as this seat to the public that returning it seemed the only way to get the message to Kohler--\"Your toilet seat is JUNK--pull it off the market and completely redesign it.\"  Three weeks with this miserable seat was enough for me and I returned mine to Amazon.", "summary": "A Flawed Design and an UnSafe Product !", "unixReviewTime": 1453075200}

This is yet another light that has the direction wrong.  It's on when screwed down tight.  It's off when loosened.  If you don't loosen it enough, it will turn on accidentally if pressed.  Fortunately, the thread has a long travel, so you can safely loosen it a lot.  It takes 10 and a half turns for the cap to screw off, so you don't need to worry about it accidentally falling off.  You can signal by first screwing the cap all the way down and then loosening it until the light just goes out.  The contacts are spring-loaded, so you can signal by repeatedly pushing and releasing the end cap (simulates a tail cap switch).

I ordered 20 x 20 and it's more like 19.5 by 19.5 which means as others have written the filter is constantly plopping down and sucking back into place every time the fan engages in my attic.  This also was not a huge deal to me since when it was sucked into place I assumed it was a pretty good seal.  The main reason I give this filter 1 star is because it is so restrictive.  My house is only 1 year old and we have the furnace in the attic and central air pump outside,  last summer we ran filtrete and kept the house super cool every day and every night with no problems.  Since switching to these filters I noticed it would take much longer for the thermostat to reach desired temp until one day my house would not even cool and we're not even to june yet.  Outside the line to my heat pump would often freeze up to solid ice and I read that was because of lack of air flow.  Last night I couldn't sleep from the heat and my AC not blowing cool air and I climbed up into the attic and took apart the furnace and found a block of ice.  These filters not only will not let my system cool but my energy bill also went up about 10 dollars a month when i switched to these from the system over working itself.  I hate to throw them away so i will probably save them for winter to use with heat mode only and go back to something else for summer.", "summary": "too loose a fit and doesn't flow air well", "unixReviewTime": 1400889600}

My garage is in the basement, above that is six inches of steel reinforced concrete which was a patio over the garage.  We later added on a second floor and added one room downstairs over the garage (patio).  Our bedroom is above that.  Consequently the signal has to go through the concrete ceiling of the garage, through the ceiling of that 1st floor room and the floor of our bedroom.  Unfortunately the signal of the Chamberlin could not always penetrate to make it to the receiver.  This unit has a stronger signal which has no problem passing through those obstacles.

But I did. And I love it.  What a fun toy! Well, it's not a toy, but I get so much pleasure out of it that it might as well be one.\n\nWhat do you get for an electronics junkie who has everything? You might consider getting this flashlight.  It has the highest light power for the smallest flashlight body that I've seen.\n\nIt has two light settings which I have termed medium and awesome:\n\n  The \"Medium\" throws a beam of 15 lumens for 47 hours.\n\n  The \"Awesome\" throws a beam of 200 lumens for 2 hours.\n\nThe light turns on two ways -one is the button on the back.  It is not a \"click on/click off\" button that you might be used to.  It is a \"push in and the light turns on, and take your finger off of the back and the light turns off\" button.  Push it in halfway and the medium beam comes on and push it in all the way and the awesome beam turns on.  Let go and it goes dark immediately.  At first I thought, well, that is interesting, but what if I want it to stay on permanently? No worries -it has a second method of turning the light on -just twist the end like a \"mag-lite\" and after a full twist the medium beam comes on, and after another half twist the awesome beam comes on.  Now it'll stay on as long as you like.\n\nUnlike most of the cheaper LED lights that I've bought in the past, this light is very high quality -it is as solid as a brick and is made fully of anodized aluminum -no cheap plastic here! It is no surprise that you often hear the words \"professional\", and \"tactical\" when reading about this light.  These Surefire lights are often used by military, hunters, aviators, and law enforcement.  It is the type of light you see on TV detective shows all the time, where the main character holds the light up and pushes the button on the back with a thumb, illuminating the darkest areas in whatever scene they are in.  It is the kind of light which I would feel safe having while walking at night, because if I shone this in someone's eyes it would definitely blind them.\n\nSpeaking of which, this light is basically the same as the self defense flashlight that Surefire sells, with two main differences: First, the self defense flashlight's medium beam is actual a low beam -it only puts out 5 lumens versus this flashlight's 15 lumens.  5 lumens is probably fine, but I find 15 lumens to be perfect for most tasks that I really need a flashlight for.  And second, the self defense flashlight has longer crenellations on the end of the flashlight -which means it would imprint some nasty bumps on someone's forehead if you poked them with it.  Though, I would rather blind someone and take off than get into a nasty situation, so I chose the higher lumened light at the lower setting, and I am very happy with that decision.\n\nThis is the perfect light to take out with you walking at night, as it will fit perfectly in a pocket, and give you a measure of comfort knowing that you'll be able to see really far away when you need to, or to blind someone or scare them if they begin stalking or attacking you.\n\nThe Surefire brand is made in America and excepting the batteries and the LED, if you register the flashlight there is a lifetime warranty.\n\nIt also comes with a lanyard so if you are doing something where you don't have easy access to your pockets, you can just hang the light from your neck.  (The lanyard, by the way, is a \"break-away\" lanyard.  If you get it caught on something, and if you pull hard enough, the lanyard will break away -to prevent choking- and it is a simple activity to get it hooked back up again.)\n\nThis light uses two 3 volt lithium batteries so you might want to buy a box of them for backup.  And, these lithium batteries last for 10 years.  (Consider also purchasing the Surefire brand of batteries.  I haven't used them long enough to vouch for them, but other reviewers seem to really think they are of a higher quality than some of the generic lithium battery brands.)\n\nBy the way, you can also buy red and blue lens covers, if you wanted to change the white beam to a red or blue beam.  I don't have them but I imagine they would be very useful in night vision situations.\n\nAnd, yes, the flashlight does come with batteries already installed.  You don't need to buy additional batteries to get started.\n\nLove this light.  Can't wait for a noise outside so I can take out my trusty Surefire and blind whatever's out there!", "summary": "If you can afford it, an absolutely wonderful light", "unixReviewTime": 1263600000}

It either came partially charged, or I charged it once. 8 months later, the batteries are still good! I would say energy retention is outstanding! Lithium-ion exhibits low self-discharge compared to NiCad and stores energy for much longer.\n\nThe keyless universal chuck means it can take drill bits of other sizes that came with other drills in my tool box. The back of the drill also has a notch for holding a second head. This is useful when changing between 2 frequently used bits.\n\nOverall, a very happy buy. It's a high-quality drill and handy to have around the house for small repairs and drilling. I only wish this set came with a carrying case for keeping all the parts together.

Pascoe", "reviewText": "I've had this machine a year now. Arrived with no problems. Checked tolerances on all aspects and all was okay. Start with the fact that band saws are cantankerous machines -- need a lot of TLC. If you are not familiar with them, beware that it takes time to learn how to set it up right. That said, this machine is an antique and belongs in a museum as they haven't improved a thing in 50 years. OTOH, it is amazing that this could be sold for around $1,000, so that is my perspective. This is the best of the low end machines, fine for hobbyists but not so fine for pros.\n\nWheels are balanced and track well. Note that vibration is usually the result of poor set up. After six months of learning how to tune it right, mine now runs perfectly smooth. Cheap blades and bad guide adjustment will make a terrible noise and vibration. I'd take the vibration complaints with a grain of salt. The problem is likely the operator and not the machine. I still use the old steel blocks that work well once you figure out how to adjust them properly.\n\nOn the postive side, all components are heavy duty stamped steel and cast iron. My machine got knocked over with a horrible crash onto concrete floor and suffered only minor damage to motor housing. The mobile base is nice, but makes it more likely to fall over.\n\nA major negative are the lower guide controls that have \"pencil\" knobs and require the use of pliers to adjust them because they are very stiff. I haven't noticed other low end machines with anything better. The Jet seems an exact copy.\n\nThe blade guides are crummy but serviceable. Not sure ball bearing guides are worth the cost. Once I got used to adjusting them, it's not a big deal. You can spend a lot of money upgrading with aftermarket parts but by the time you're done you might just as well have bought a better saw from the get go.\n\nMy tension adjuster crapped out after 6 months. The standard threads couldn't handle the stress. I bought the machine wheel upgrade from Highland Hardware which is a 6\" wheel (not a finger-breaking 2\" knob) with Acme threads. I highly recommend it. Worth every penny of $60. I also bought the Kreg fence which, with these two items makes it a decent machine at additional cost of about $200.00. Another $200 for bearing guides and this'd be a fine machine. It's probably no coincidence that all the negatives are upgradable!!!\n\nSet up right, it performs reasonably well. I routinely saw 1/16 x 6\" wide veneers accurately with little strain on the motor. Using the right feed rate and sharp blades is critical. If you buy this machine be prepared to spend some time learning to adjust and use it right and it will perform well for you. If you think you can just start jamming pieces of wood thru it without knowledge, you'll be disappointed and end up writing nasty reviews.", "summary": "Depends on what you want", "unixReviewTime": 1165622400}

There are no assembly instructions included, but it is easy to figure out. You remove the screw in the base and then put the bracket from the lamp over the screw hole, and screw the screw back in. It allows 360 movement on the base and a little more than 90 tilt up/down.\n\nThere are 20 LED white lights that have two modes  low and bright. One press on the power button in the back left turns it on low and another press turns it to high. You can see in the video that it does a nice job of illuminating your target. The right power button turns on a flashing red/blue light combination. This color combination is odd as I thought those colors were reserved for law enforcement. They are not very bright, but could be useful if your bar broke down and you wanted to alert other motorists. You can press both buttons and have all 24 LEDS on at the same time.\n\nThere are two USB charging ports in the back of the lamp that can be used to top off any of your devices if they are running low on electrons. The ports are covered by a flimsy green plastic flap. The charging port is also located here. There are no battery indicators on the lamp. You know when it is charged as the red light on the charger goes from red to green. I was concerned with something I read in the manual. It says not to charge the light for over 24 hours. Does this mean that it will overheat? Makes me a little nervous.\n\nI see myself leaving this in the trunk of my car for emergencies. The rubber handle on the top makes it easy to carry and the rubber feet on the bottom help to keep it in place. The price is also reasonable.\n\nDisclaimer: Product sample provided for free or discounted for an honest unbiased review with no means of payment or incentives offered in exchange.", "summary": "Nice portable rechargeable light", "unixReviewTime": 1454198400}

I figured if it worked at all, it would be worth every penny.  It is.\n\nThe lights are very soothing, and can be adjusted almost any way you want.  All colors, some colors, or one color; moving and changing or still; constant colors or some fading in or out.  The ability to tilt it over makes it much more versatile, since it can be put at the edge of the room and still fill the entire ceiling (note that the tilting mechanism enables it to tilt towards the controls on the base, not in other directions - some people seemed to have a little trouble figuring out which way it went).  The overall design is very aesthetically pleasing, and will fit almost any dcor.  The materials seem to be pretty good quality.\n\nThe only two things I might consider changing aren't really negatives at all, but I feel they should be mentioned.  The sounds that come with this aren't quite as soothing as I would prefer for a nursery (or myself, really) - they're nature sounds, but most of them do have a sudden, loud sound (bird calling or something similar) every once in a while.  But if you have a baby and don't already have an app like Relax Melodies to use on your phone instead, you're missing out.  I'd also love to see a battery built in so that the projector can more easily be moved from one room to another, depending on where it's needed at the moment.  Our plug is behind a piece of furniture, but we can easily fix that problem with a  $1 extension cord.  I guess a battery would also drive the price up $5-10, which may put this item out of the reach of some parents who could really use it.  And of course, the instructions are in broken English, but that's exactly what I expected.  This thing is completely self-explanatory anyway.\n\nI do love the remote, and the ability to control it from a distance.  If your fussy baby has just fallen asleep on you, you know you're not going to be getting up to change it manually anytime soon.  I also really like the timer feature, which can be useful for all kinds of things.  Save energy by not running it overnight, or turn off the sound so that your baby doesn't become dependent on noise to sleep.  Or maybe the best one - use the 8 hour timer for toddlers, to teach them that while the light is on, it's sleeping time.  They can't get out of bed (and come wake you up) until that light goes off.  It's called \"OK to wake\", and it's becoming a very popular thing to train for.  Most of the devices that support this are fairly expensive.

But a couple tips. First the blade while not razor thin (that would probably break anyway) it does have a slight double sided bevel and gets harder to turn as the walls of the bevel on either side of the blade run into thicker and thicker walls of cut PVC pipe on either side. Friction goes up and it simply makes sense it gets harder and harder to turn. Lessening the depth for each go around does not lessen the increase in friction. Holding the pipe still becomes very hard without a vise. Second (you can) grab a PVC right angle or other type of end piece and wedge it to the bottom without glue or cement. The friction of a slightly imperfectly aligned end piece wedged against the walls of a large pipe makes an excellent \"lever\" to counter the torque caused by the cutting blade in very cramped and awkward compartments, like in a crawl space. I'm a small guy and was able to wedge the right angle PVC fitting between my boots while I perfectly cut a section of pipe about as long as my torso. Also the roller pin that holds the blade in the center fork is held in place by a cotter pin or rotating ring washer that fits in a groove around the axis of the roller pin. This can pop out if the fork or the blade is torqued or twisted in the wrong way. In tight quarters this is very possible.. in the near dark almost a certainty. The cut will still be level and clean, but those last few millimeters the blade has the most frictional torque twisting it in the groove its cutting.

It feels so much better and is much easier to twist the cap in your palm or your fingertips, depending on how you hold it, to turn it on and off.\n\nIf you want a personal illumination tool that you'll value and hold dear for years, get one of these.

The older fixture was smaller, but I was able to cut a larger hole in the wallboard and mount the new fixture below the old one and still make it flush with the ceiling, because the fixture is thinner than the wall board. The light is very uniform across the plate, and is much  brighter than the old fixture which had a single 25W CFL (equivalent to a 100W incandescent). This completely uniform lighting gets it my 5-star rating.\n\nThere is a half-second lag from flipping the switch until the fixture lights up. This is OK in my application, but be warned.\n\nThere were no instructions. You are on your own to figure out how to install the clips onto the fixture and then how to clip the fixture into the hole. You get not guidance about mounting the driver PS. I speculate that the driver will last longer if it is not simply sitting atop the fixture, since most electronics last longer if they are cooler.", "summary": "great product, no instructions.", "unixReviewTime": 1478736000}

Had never really used a planer (powered or otherwise) before, but thought I'd give it a try versus the mess created by using a belt-sander or similar.  Plus, at less than $60, if it worked reasonably well, how could I go wrong?\n\nEven though this is a tool I'm only likely to use rarely, I have to admit, it really does work well for its purpose.  I'm not a carpenter or anything, just a homeowner DIY-type who likes to try to do things myself versus always paying someone else to do it for me.  Truthfully, sometimes I'm more successful than others.  I'd \"planed\" sticking or miss-aligned doors in the past using a belt-sander.  That method worked okay, but made a mess and it was easy to \"over-sand\". So I got the Ryobi planer and gave it a shot. Wow! I can't speak as to how this Ryobi compares to other powered planers, but it sure impressed me! It took down the doors no problem.  The first door I did I just used the included debris bag.  It did an \"okay\" job, but still alot of dust was released into the workspace. The next couple of doors I did, I just inserted my shop-vac hose (smaller shop-vac) into the planer's blow-out port I was using, turned on the shop-vac and started planing. That worked like a charm!  Almost no dust or debris got away from the tool and shop-vac.\n\nThe planer seemed to be plenty powerful for my needs. It has decent \"heft\" to it. It comes with a spare set of blades (the installed ones and the included extra set are both reversible, so they should last for quite awhile), the dust/debris bag and the metal guides. For a rookie at planing, I am very impressed with the tool and at the price I got it, would definitely recommend it. My only gripe is that the unit I received had a lot of sawdust on the tool and the interior of its case.  Now I recognize that I am buying a \"reconditioned\" tool, but is it too much to ask that the tool and its case be vacuumed off a bit when it is in the reconditioning (whatever that means......) process?  10 seconds with a shop-vac by the seller and that is one gripe I wouldn't have had!!!!", "summary": "Casual User----Worked Great!

I came across this saw at the home center that came with the heavy duty Miter saw stand.  It came with the two brackets to mount to quick mount the saw.  $200 stand for free.  Awesome!  I did all the standard straight cuts stacking outdoor landscape lumber as high as it would fit.  Two high, two wide was enough for me to risk and it sliced right through, sliding all the way up to 16\".  Amazing.  I bought over my needs for a reason.  I was repairing my bench seat for the dining room and this saw has a depth stop that allowed me to fine tune like a table saw so that I could mimic dado cuts.  I cut a 1x1 down to 9/16\" by 5/16\" that was \" long of a peg on each side.  After I made the marks, just do the quick blade depth adjustment and I was sawing.  It has really inspired my wood working for 2014.  It cuts all the way to 55* on each side.  Has quick stops for 22.5 and 38 something degrees.  I know crown molding uses one of them.  This saw can do all that any miter out there can do.\n\nIt has a saw dust catch bag.  My garage would probably look better if I used it or a vac system.\nThere is also an adjustable clamp that mounts to the saw to help reduce losing fingers.\nThe LED is an awesome upgrade from nothing and it is better than a laser bc if a laser isn't set up right your line isn't right.  This shadows the blade and it works perfect to setup your cut.

Contrary to the documents, it does seem to work with a <40w bulb.\n\nIt is NOT DIMMABLE. That seems like a fabulous feature of the older and no longer available LM20 modules. Those older 20s were a lot more robust. I wish they were still available. What could possibly be a good reason for removing the dimmable feature? That seems like the coolest part of all this remote control voodoo.\n\nX-10 seems to flaunt the \"no dial setting required\" as some kind of feature. I don't see that as a feature in the least. Turning two simple dials with a screwdriver was certainly not a challenge. It's a lot more work to program the silly thing using the lamp and controller plugged into the same outlet method that is now required.\n\nOverall it's a step backwards in features, reliability and versatility.

I went to Lowe's and all they sold were ceiling fan down-rods.  I wanted a thin rod like the orb itself.  I discovered a mini pendant light that came with an adjustable rod up to 69.57 inches.  It was only $20 and perfect for my vaulted ceilings.  For $20 I could justify buying it for parts!  I drilled a hole in the bottom of the rod and hooked two large key rings through it so that I could attach the orb to it's new rod.  I painted the key rings with some oil rubbed bronze paint I had on hand so that everything matched.  My hubs used the canopy from the pendant so the the rod would connect easily and the wiring was just like any light.  I also purchased a crystal off Amazon to bling up my chandelier.

If I could give this an extra star for customer service, I would. While trying to redirect the light last week, I slipped, pulled the front off, and broke the battery cover. It seems that the battery cover is very important: the light doesn't work without it. I wrote to Mr Beams, and they said that they would replace the whole unit at no charge, and today - 4 days later - I received the new unit. It works like a charm, and I'm grateful for the excellent customer service that they provided. Btw, it's been two months, and they haven't skipped a beat or beam as the case may be. They're working fine, and the light is bright enough to cover the doors and immediate walkways.\n\n****\n\nI got the two MB360s LED Spotlight Motion Sensors so that I didn't have to leave front and back lights on when we were gone for a day, and then when we got home, these would light up the doors (and locks) and, if necessary, I could turn on the lights from the garage. I've never thought of using these before, but recently our little cul de sac has had three new families move in and they're evidently saving on their electric bills.\n\nAnd then there was the safety factor: If there are intruders - and I include raccoons, opossums, and once even a wayward tiger that was reported by our neighborhood watch (it was, not quite as I expected - but close - the fattest cat in the neighborhood: didn't even have stripes!) - when these lights go off, the prism that magnifies the light does quite a job. It lights up half of the outside of our house and all the nooks and crannies that are out there.\n\nI was concerned about wearing out 4 D Cell batteries every few weeks because as a motion sensor, they might go off in the daytime. But these are set to go off only when there is little light between sunset and sunrise.\n\nI know that some have said that these are easily installed. Well, charge your electric drill because each comes with two 3.5-inch very thin screws per light. My drill was dead as a doornail, and the wood that I was using has been \"cured\" by 40 years of paint and sun-baked. It took 30 minutes for the first one to screw it in by hand. When my brain had enough power to have a light bulb go off, I just waited for the drill/screwdriver to charge. Still not so easy since they really are VERY thin screws.\n\nSo far, they're working fine. We haven't had a raccoon or possum in over 24 hours! No burglars either unless you consider Sydney, our neighborhood squirrel, the biggest thief of the bunch.

LEDs, and CFL, home lighting is the way most of us are going in order to reduce our power bills.  Sleeklighting brings to the table these chandelier bulbs, which will fit a variety of lighting solutions, but not all.  As is common, the LED bulb is taller and fatter than the standard incandescent bulb of the same type.  Roughly 3/4\" taller and 1/4\" wider.  This is something to consider, as the extra size may not fit your need.  Also, this product *IS NOT DIMMABLE*.  LEDs operate differently than CFL or incandescent bulbs, such that reducing the voltage to them does not cause them to dim, which is how the majority of dimmer switches work. LEDs need the supplied current to vary, rather than voltage.\n\nAlso unlike CFL or incandescent bulbs, LEDs produce focus light beams, whereas the others radiate light in every direction.  To get around this, the Sleeklighting bulb is ringed with LEDs all the way around the primary shaft, as well as at top of the shaft.  It does a pretty good job of spreading the light around, but I think the lack of a covering to further diffuse the light is problematic. The diffusing cuts down the overall brightness and sharpness of the light while also spreading it about.  Given that these bulbs are for chandeliers, the light being produced is in my opinion at bit too bright and sharp for that use.  The exception being if the chandelier in question is mounted high up, like on a vaulted ceiling, which will tone down the lighting as it travels and bounces off surfaces.  A group of these, undimmed, in a standard household chandelier which is often 6' high, may be too intense.  No intimate dinner with these bad boys!  They may be too intense for small beside lamps as well, even with a shade.\n\nI do think this is a great product, but it will take some time to see just how long it will last.  In theory, unless plugged into a dimmer, they should last a good long time, making the investment on them well worth it.", "summary": "Shield my eyes!", "unixReviewTime": 1401062400}

Installation was unbelievably easy--the bolts tightened up right away and stayed tight. Fit was perfect.  Wood finish was excellent to begin with and has remained that way.  Stainless screws are the right material for this application.  The chrome has tarnished a bit over time, but it cleaned up nicely with Nevr-Dull metal polish.  In sum, the seats look about as good now as they did when they came out of the box.\n\nTwo minor problems.  First, the hardware that came with the seats was not the same as illustrated in the instructions.  The manufacturer's website has the same obsolete instructions.  That leaves the question of how to sequence the washers.  Please see Kris M.'s accompanying Amazon.com review for the answer.\n\nSecond, after a year and a half, one of the nylon nuts cracked and dropped off.  I was able to quickly improvise a repair using a hex nut.  Then I emailed the manufacturer about the broken nylon nut.  Got an immediate and courteous response that a replacement part would be shipped the same day.  It arrived two days later.  I appreciate that the manufacturer's customer service is on a par with the high quality of the product.  With the OEM part the seat is as good as new.\n\nIn sum, these toilet seats are highly recommended.  It seems to me that the people who put so much thought and quality into this product would deserve the Nobel Prize for Toilet Seats if there were such a thing.\n\nFollow-up, 2016.
