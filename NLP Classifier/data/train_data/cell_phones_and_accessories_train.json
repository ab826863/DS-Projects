Figured even if it was a dud I couldn't go too wrong at that price.  I don't use the phone or sim.  I just use it to connect to wifi for FB, library, weather, photos, etc. I had wanted to use it as a radio for when I'm out walking the dog, but so far the only app I've found insists I agree to let at&t charge me mega amounts for the data use, so I passed on that. But that's ok, my REAL (non at&t) phone has a radio with no charge for using it.\nThe missing star is because I find taking photos with it a hassle. I think my photo button is broken, so I have to find the app, which wants to show me pics when I want to take one, and wants to take one when I want to look at pics taken. I have to wrestle it into submission. hard to see what I'm doing when out in the sun...  but, somehow I have managed to get a few good shots.\nAlso, and I don't know if this is just a component of all smart phones or just this one, but it's unreliable in it's functions on the web. On FB sometimes I'll have to stab LIKE ten times to get it to take, sometimes it won't re-orient it's self when I turn it for a wider view, and sometimes it won't expand something I'm trying to look at, or will suddenly be too sensitive, taking orders I didn't give, driving me nuts and sending me back to my computer.  But all in all, for 19.99 it's nice to have access to the web when not sitting in front of my computer.  I'm glad I didn't pay any more than that though.\nUPDATE:  1 1/2 yrs later.  at least 25 times a day I'd like to throw this thing at a wall.  Like I said above, I got it to use as a portable FB, mostly but other things too.  The Windows-created App for FB (you have to download it from the windows store) is a bloody nightmare, Seriously, it crashes, (which means it drops you out of FB and back to your start page maybe every 3 - 5 minutes.  I kid you not.  Thank god I've still got a desktop computer or I would have killed this thing by now.  Evidently Windows went on to make OTHER versions for their newer, pricier phones, and have said f.u. to the lumina 520 users.  It never upgrades. i've uninstalled it and reinstalled in hopes of getting a better version.  No such luck.  it's just a peice of you know what.  But all my other apps are fine as wine. I can games for hours, NO PROBLEMO!  It's just the windows FB app.  Thanks Mr Gates.  ..not.  Oh, and one other thing, since we can only get apps from the windows store, wouldn't it be NICE if windows would make a bloomin APP for THAT? Instead of making us navigate their PC website which our phone HATE.  I finally started using App of the day, but you can't just go shopping with that, you get what they deliver.  if you want to look for an app...  such nonsense...", "summary": "Not bad, if you get it cheap", "unixReviewTime": 1433116800}

Cases fit my iPhone 5S and my new iPhone 6S Plus.\n4.  4 Lenses:  Telephoto 4x-12x, Wide Angle, Macro and Fisheye - Love each of these - add great functionality to my phone's camera.\n5.  I do wish that the clip could be redesigned to be a little more secure.  It does work well...but it's on it's tippy toes.  It would also be nice to have a little case or something to be able to easily store everything together and not lose any parts.  It does come with 2 little drawstring bags - but those are very limited in function.\n6.  Easy to use\n\nOverall - love this kit.  It offers a lot more options and functions than other phone lens kits.  Pictures are clear and perfect.\n\nI received a free product in order to provide my fair and honest review.

The Roadster 2 is mediocre at best and I would not recommend that unit at all.

I give that one less star than this Roadster Pro.  Just as good for the user but the Roadster pro deserves one star above the Jabra Freeway for better noise cancelling.  Your caller hears you much clearer.\n\nHowever, the Jabra gets one more star than the Roadster pro for overall features because it has a built in FM modulator allowing you to use it to transfer audio, be it a call or music, from your phone to your car audio speakers.  That being said, the Jabra FM modulator really only works if you are either in the middle of no-where or standing still because the FM channels all around you will overpower the Jabra as you drive along if you are anywhere metropolitan.\n\nIf the replacement Roadster pro that I get back has adequate battery life then I will review this \"review\" and give it 4 stars.

Many phones had 4g when this came out.) The front facing cam will make no one look good (it's atrocious) and the main camera was left to be unsaid. Waste of 18mp when it doesn't fully support snapchat easily. And yes, this phone does get hot very easily on its right side. Open the slider and don't use videos galore while fast charging.

The battery thing does suck when it's heated, but not a reason to run from this beautiful phone.

I have used so many different materials of clear film screen protectors and many tempered glass screen protectors from different brands in the last 5 years. I have tried almost all kinds of screen protector on the market and they were absolutely terrible. The ArmorSuit is so far one of the best on the market especially for the \"Edge\" phone. It provides Edge to edge coverage (most of the brands don't cover the curve part of the edge phone). Easy to install. The most accurate cutting for all sensors/camera holes and home button.\n\nWhen you do the installation, try to do it at the end of the night before you go to bed, because it is better to take some time to dry, you don't need to use your phone while you're sleeping. What I did was that I got it all lined up and pushed the water out. If you notice dust, hair or anything underneath the film, you can lift the film back up, clean it off and wet it again to apply on your device. After letting it dry overnight, I can't tell that there's a screen protector on. It is so perfectly fit my phone that you can't even see it.\n\nHere is how I installed this:\n1. Clean the screen thoroughly with the provided micro cloth.\n\n2. Spray both of your hands, fingers and screen with the solution provided.\n\n3. Peel off the screen and spray on the adhesive side of the screen (unlike many other screen protector, you only need to peel off one side of the\nscreen, the adhesive side, there is no second peel off step for the back side).\n\n4. Align the screen protector on your device, you can slide until you get a desired result.\n\n5. Use the very nice soft squeegee they provide to smudge out the fluid and air bubbles.\n\n6. Use a hair dryer on low setting to heat it up a little after I had it position right to make it tack up faster and rubbed around all the edges to make\nsure it stuck good (If you do notice dust, hair or anything you can lift it back up, clean it off an wet it again to apply it).\n\n7. Leave it on the table and go to sleep, all imperfection such as hard to kill tiny bubbles and vapor will disappear (Yes! they will disappear by\nthemselves).\n\n8. Now you have a nicely protected S7 Edge without even noticing that the screen is there. Enjoy!!!\n\nHope this helps!", "summary": "Great screen protector", "unixReviewTime": 1473897600}

Since I never use the CD player on my car, I found that this particular mount worked out pretty well in my unique use case. As far as mounting goes, it does its job fairly well, and passed the test by surviving a four-hour drive through desert roads last week.\n\nThe mount works via a strong rare-earth magnet attached to the mount's face (I have no idea how this harms the phone long-term, however) and the mount itself comes with two sets of plates to use, one of which was a flat rectangular one that I slide below my iPhone 6's case. The mount is sturdy and holds the phone surprisingly well.\n\nOne caveat though: if you have a navigation system, the wing nut used to secure the rubber part that goes in the CD tray blocks your view quite a bit.

I usually leave the phone in the case just because I don't like to worry about running out of power during the day.

I've found Find My iPhone to be a useful feature when I lose my phone or my iPad, and the idea of being able to affix such a find function to anything is appealing.

It's also really easy to set up -- download the app, make a free account, sync the Tile with your account, and you're done.\n\nThe downsides are small but notable. For one, the chime the Tile makes is rather quiet and easily muffled by, say, a couch cushion. Second, the Tile is obviously designed to be a key fob, and it looks great on keys. For things without a \"ring,\" though, it's got to be stuck on, and it's not terribly elegant as a sicker -- in fact, it's kind of big and clunky. For example, I considered sticking it on the TV remote, since the kids are ALWAYS losing it. But there's nowhere on the remote that's big enough, flat enough, and free enough of buttons to stick it.

I forgave it when the battery capacity dwindled to only good enough for one bike ride.  But then suddenly one day it lost its stereo sound and I knew the day had come to replace it.  So bear with me if I compare this one to that one a little.\n\nThe good:\n\n--Obviously, the battery life is very good, 8 hours plus (but this was true of the first one when it was new.  I expect this one will also slowly shrink down over time).\n--The Bluetooth connection is so much easier.  Once paired the first time, subsequent powering on automatically connects to my phone.  With the old model, I had to go through settings screens to confirm the pairing.\n--There's a nice new feature where if you hit the volume up button without music playing, the voice announces your battery level (stated as \"high\" and presumably \"low\" (I haven't tried this when it was below \"high\")).\n--I like the button design better, much much easier to feel through your shirt.  And, contrary to some complaints that the buttons are too sensitive, I think the power button isn't sensitive enough.  It takes me one or two tries to turn it on or off.  The FF/REW button is just right.  Kind of weird having the volume buttons on the side though, wish they could go where the FM button is (more on that later).\n--Much prefer the headset jack on the top rather than the side, just easier to manage the cord that way\n--The sound is fantastic.\n--Just like its predecessor, very lightweight, you forget it's even there.\n\nNow, the bad:\n\n--First and foremost, the earbuds that come with it are simply awful, and stupidly without them it loses its lanyard function (but at least when you remove the earbuds, there are pieces on the back with tiny holes that you can thread a very thin keyring through to use a lanyard of your own).\n--The biggest reason I took off one star:  The FM button.  Really?  Why not just include a Sony Walkman attachment?  Does anyone listen to FM radio anymore?  In the car maybe, but I wear this for exercising and radio ads have a terrible beat, and tend to be incessant.  I wish this could be re-purposed to something more useful, like volume or maybe just a call answer button.\n--The battery life is great, but on the old one when you got the first low battery notification, you still had a good hour left.  On this, you get three or four warnings over about fifteen minutes and then you're done.\n\nIn summary, overall a vast improvement over the older model.  Now get rid of that useless FM button!", "summary": "Three steps forward, two steps back", "unixReviewTime": 1435881600}

I can't speak to that, I purchased this model of phone directly from the AT&T store. My review reflects the actual product that I purchased.\n\nI purchased my Desire Eye through AT&T and so far could not be happier! I felt that this was a BIG improvement from the M7, and even though it's in the same model range as the M8 I think that it is vastly superior. They finally got rid of the ultra-pixel camera (what the heck was that about) and now this beauty takes amazing quality photos and is so reasonably priced compared to the M8 and now especially the M9. I ended up picking this over the M9 simply based on price. I felt the M9 wasn't a significant enough improvement over this model to warrant the crazy price difference. Lollipop for Android was also recently released for this model.\n\nMy only gripe with this phone is the vibrate. It's so quiet I hardly ever hear it or feel it. I'm an anti-chime person, so I miss calls and texts all the time. Additionally, I'm a big fan of OtterBox but because this model isn't as coveted as the M-line, there aren't many color options, leaving me with an off-brand case that has held up reasonably but doesn't feel the same.\n\nEDIT 9/13/2016: I've had this phone for a year and a half and it still runs like a dream. I have the option to upgrade after 2 years, but I might save myself some money and keep this model unless a vastly superior phone comes out.

As such it is quite thick once you're loaded up, but in total its less volume than a regular phone case plus a typical wallet.  There are 3 explicit card pockets which can be doubled up, though I do think it would rip if you always kept them doubled up. Behind that there's a fold for more cards or money, and yet another full length pocket behind that.  I keep a few cases depending on occasions, so I do often carry a separate wallet, but for certain events, travel, etc. this is ideal to really consolidate what you're carrying.  Phone fits well, no issues getting it in, out, or plugging in, etc.  The texture is nice, has kind of an embossed abstract floral texture.  With all of the heft, it will likely cushion quite a fall as well. It's not really designed for an impact, but the leather or leather like material, and layers would probably protect better than some impact cases in a drop situation.

Not only it lasts for about 19hrs depending on the usage but it also recharges very quickly. In 45 minutes for the battery that was half depleted it charged it to full capacity.  That really impressed me not having to wait for 3hrs+\nPairing  Very easy to connect to any phones.  Took me less than 5 seconds to connect it to my Iphone 6+ as well my G4 and my passport.  The use of the button to click on to take the picture is very well designed as well as positioned.  Not too hard to the touch when deciding to take a picture.\n\nOverall the Anker selfie Bluetooth stick is an extremely well designed product light to the touch and extremely easy to manipulate / use.

The next best cases I've had would be the Spigen slim armor or the Tech 21 case.

I've dropped this from the roof of my SUV and the phone was fine! I'm a bit clumsy when it comes to dropping my phone, and I've put this case to some rigorous testing and it has passes with excellent form. Whatever material Magpul is using is perfect for this type of application. Probably partly lucky nothing ever broke, but that also speaks really well of the case. The case itself has held up better appearance-wise than any other, it doesn't really scratch. I thought the field case form was just for looks, but now realize it helps significantly with grip. I can put this phone on my dash and it does not slide while making a turn. (Magpul sells a phone without the field case grip too)\nCONS: One problem I have with this case is that the hole for the 3.5mm headphone jack did not accommodate most accessory cables for use on speaker or car stereo systems.

Devices used include:  LG G2, Samsung S4, Samsung S3, Sony Xperia Z3, HTC 626S and Asus ZenFone 2.  All charged okay, but the LG G2 would only pull .45A for some reason.  Several different USB cables were tried, as well as another G2.  The LG G2 should easily pull +1A on a low battery, and does on other chargers.  It's almost like charger was reading the device had a nearly charged battery and was holding at a lower charge rate.\n\nThe iSmart Technology is supported to detect the correct maximum charge rate for each device and I'm wondering if perhaps there is some type of incompatibility occurring.  The charger certainly does work on the LG G2, but just at a lower charge rate.\n\nWhile this is not a vendor review, it makes sense to mention that RAVPower was speedy to reply to my email inquiry about the low charge rate and a replacement was sent out, but it demonstrated the same issue.", "summary": "Good charger, but it does not like my LG G2", "unixReviewTime": 1448150400}

Hill", "reviewText": "The unit onsists of two pieces, a spring-loaded tablet holder and a suction cup base. With it, you can securely attach a 7 to 10.5 inch tablet to any clean, flat glass surface - like a windshield.\n\nStarting with a clean surface, it was easy to attach the suction cup by pressing it into place and pushing down the lever to secure it. After it was attached, I tried vigorously to pull it off and slide it around with absolutely no success - it was securely moored to the glass.\n\nAttached to the base is a two-piece arm assembly, the bottom part of which moves up and down, while the upper part is connected with a ball and socket joint so it moves and swivels in all directions. Both arms can be tightened in the desired position by turning the attached knobs clockwise.\n\nNext I inserted my tablet diagonally between the two corner brackets of the holder. This arrangement not only prevents the device from slipping, but also avoids blocking either the control buttons or the camera lens opening on both the 7 and 10.5 inch tablets that I used for testing. The spring tension coupled with the rubbery corner-hugging blocks in the mount safely cradles the tablet. Not loose but not too tight.\n\nThe entire mounting bracket is easy to reposition or reattach elsewhere. Since the unit uses springs to hold the tablet, it is simple to insert and remove while leaving the base in place. The suction cup base is no problem to detach by first lifting the lock lever, than pulling the tab on the suction cup to break the seal with the glass. The instructions on the package sleeve indicate that the suction cup can be cleaned with warm water and air-dried to restore it. I attached and removed it several times with no noticeable degradation in holding power.\n\nOff-label use, the device is also great for mounting a tablet on the underside of a glass table. I was able to position it at an angle that was clearly viewable and controllable through the table glass.\nOther options include mounting it on a bathroom mirror for use when shaving or getting ready for the day, on a glass patio tabletop so it is positioned for optimal viewing and safe from an accidental drop, or even mounted to a window for a variety of uses or to free-up desk space.\n\nThis mounting bracket is built solidly and performed flawlessly.

I'm not a guru in this area, so I can only state what I see, feel, like or dislike. In saying that, I can be opposite in my thinking or views than his on many items I'm not really sure of. Well, I really like this. The suction is strong, not limited because of its moveable arm and no dash will block the camera if we want to record a road trip. This is a sturdy cell phone holder and I don't mind it if placed on the windshield, it doesn't block my view where he placed it and this is my favorite that has come into the house...or should I say vehicle. His view may be different than mine, but I really do like this one far better than the vent holders or magnetic ones.\n\nHe says\nAs you see this is my wifes favorite from the many smartphone holders I have been testing in the search for the 1 mount that works for us all. So far I had settled on a simple mount design, a chrome ball and magnet design. I myself like it but my wife does not as she never gets it on the magnet straight and in turn sends the phone across the car on her first turn. I figured this holder with a flexible arm would be the winner and in turn saved it to the end almost to review. First off the suction cup does work well and has a pump tab to lock it to the windshield. But I never thought of it until I mounted it, being a flexible arm it will bounce as we drive down the road. Double vision will drive me batty after a short time. And being mounted in the middle of the window low it is nice, but still creates a blind spot for me. Being around cars as a past career and driving since 14 (yes I said 14) I don't like anything to block my view point. Mounting this unit on the side to be next to the driver's window was better than the center and easier for me to reach and read, but still created a blind spot for me. Besides being flexible, this unit is neat being it has a clamp to hold the phone, a very strong clamp, that I like to ensure a good grip. So in turn as a vehicle mount this unit does not work for me, but I do see this unit being optimized in our RV instead. As this will be perfect to mount the phone next to the table while we are eating or working. And to be mounted back in the bedroom as well next to the bed, even in the bathroom on the mirror as my wife just chimed in. So for us this mount works in other means than it is advertised for, but in the end we give it a 4 stars because it does work, is flexible, compact and grips the phone well.\n\nTo give our quirky and honest opinion of this product, we received a discount. We give nothing but our unbiased opinion, being we expect the same in return. No greenbacks were traded for this review nor does Amazon or the seller influence our decisions.

Installation was standard and I had no issues aligning it.  I started install by aligning the top of the protector.  I have a Caseology Wavelength Series Case and I left it on during the install.  The case assisted with the alignment.  Since Ive only had the protector on for a few hours it is early to determine the wear and tear over time.  I have some concern that the edges will lift up over time, but only time will tell.  For now I\"ve very happy with this screen protector.\n\nUpdate May 4 - I installed this screen protector on April 25th.  I have been happy with the touch sensitivity and general appearance of the G-Color protector.  However, today I noticed white spots thinking initially they were on the outside of the glass.  However, after cleaning realized they are \"under\" the glass!!  I'm assuming it is dust that has moved in from the edge of the glass, between my case and the glass.\n I've sent an email to G-Color for assistance and will update after I hear from them.\n\nUpdate May 6 - G-Color has confirmed this screen protector does have an issue with the curved edges of the Galaxy S7 and dust will move in under the screen as only the edges have adhesive and as they come loose dust moves in.  G-Color has just release a new verision.  I've ordered on from Amazon and will review when received.  The new version is titled ---  Galaxy S7 Screen Protector (FULL COVERAGE), G-Color 0.2mm 3D Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 with Lifetime Warranty.

I'd heard a lot about it, and I was intrigued enough to want to check it out.  Like many, I somehow thought it was more like a GPS device that could communicate from afar.  When I learned it was not, I was ever more intrigued about how, exactly, this thing works.\n\nSo, the basic premise of this Tile is that most of the time you lose things that are close to you--within the range of your Bluetooth signal on your phone.  If you are outside that range, which Tile claims is about a 100-foot radius, then the best that Tile can do is tell you where it was when it lost contact with you.  That MIGHT be helpful, if it doesn't move from that location, but if somebody else picks up your device and moves it when you are out of range, then you are toast, unless a miracle happens (see next paragraph).\n\nMiracles do occasionally happen, and Tile seems to think that enough people around the planet will adopt this doodad that we will all be finding one another's lost stuff within 100 feet of us and getting it back to the rightful owner.  This seems like a profound stretch to me.  If it is valuable enough for you to put a Tile on it, then it is just as likely, perhaps more likely, to never be returned to you if somebody finds it.  In order for a benevolent citizen to come to your rescue and find your device, they would need to own Tile, have their Bluetooth turned on, and get within 100 feet of your lost item before the evildoer gets your item.  Even if this happened, you or a benevolent citizen would still need to get the lost item from the found location before another evildoer came along.  I like to believe in the good of mankind, but this requires more than just goodness.  It requires goodness with a Tile app on phone, with Bluetooth turned on, within 100 feet of your lost item, with a quick action to retrieve the lost item before it is picked up and moved by somebody else.  I'll buy my lottery tickets before I bet on this alignment of the lost item moons.\n\nThen there are the very practical drawbacks of this item.  It is 25 bucks, it lasts only a year (at which point it is garbage, with no replaceable battery), and it can be synchronized with only 1 phone.  When my wife and I both installed the app and tried to find the same item, we soon learned that the only way this was going to work was to have the Tile associated with just one of our phones.  If you read the Q&A on Amazon, a couple of other folks also wanted to do what my wife and I wanted to do, because it is logical, but it doesn't work.  #Fail\n\nPerhaps I will one day be like Steve Ballmer when the iPhone launched--dismissing it as nothing compared to Windows phones--and I will have to admit that I didn't understand the potential of Tile.  Until then, I am lost, and Tile cannot help me.", "summary": "I am lost, and Tile cannot help me.", "unixReviewTime": 1419724800}

I decided to stick with this particular case because I was trying to stay with something as portable/low profile as possible without adding a ton of bulk to my slim style laptop bag, and that I would keep the charging cable with the device on the bottom section, and keep any extra flex cables in the upper compartment separately, so that the case closes better without putting unnecessary stress on the battery itself. I also noticed that after one night of having the device and cables inside the case (zipped up), that the case did loosen up a little bit... so it is a little forgiving even though it is a hard case. I honestly don't think I could have found another low profile hard case that was any closer in dimensions for our Mophie Powerstation XL device, without having to go with a huge case, or something taller... so save yourself the trouble if you don't have a lot of time to research for the best case... this is as close to perfect as you can really get for the Mophie Powerstation XL & Powerstation Duo devices.", "summary": "Great case fitment for the Mophie Powerstation XL battery pack & cables!

I am not bothered too much by them, but this is quite the preferred system: This charger has three indicator lights that can either blink or light up completely according to the current battery charge level - and there are little depictions next to each LED that illustrates what each level corresponds to. Multiple indicators are my ideal way of reading portable chargers as one light ones can sometimes be relatively ambiguous.\n\nThe battery lasts and it charges well, what more could I ask for? Additionally the size and lights are all perfect for my needs so I have no complaints there. So in the end, I am glad I got to pick up this battery charger and I am thankful I got it at a discounted price no less.  I want to point out that I did get the reduced price as I had ordered it for evaluative purposes. However all of my findings are truthful and only based on what I _personally_ have experienced firsthand!", "summary": "The weight and size is good and very fitting for what the device can do", "unixReviewTime": 1467676800}

She was tired of not having enough fingers to take decent pictures and often used other body parts like toes, knees, her nose....I'm sure a few people out there are nodding in agreement that they've done the same thing as her!  There are not many Bluetooth  remotes out there that are compatible with her older model phone.\n\nI was surprised to come across this remote boasting that it would be compatiable with her phone.  I didn't hesitate at the opportunity to give this remote a try and see if it really would work.\n\nThis remote comes with a quick start user manual and an extra battery.  I would personally like a remote to have the ability to charge using a USB cable, but this remote comes with an extra battery and the type of battery it uses is a fairly common one.  Once we turned on the Bluetooth from the ol' S3, it immediately recognized the remote and we were in business.  Needless to say, the remote works just fine with the phone's camera.  There is a suggested app that is listed on the manual which allows one to use more features of the remote, such as the zoom in and out  This remote also worked on her iPad.\n\nThis is a reasonably priced remote that has done everything this listing has stated.  It's small enough to fit a pocket or can be attached to a keyring or lanyard with a small notch located at the top of the remote.  Since the wife is happy with how it works and is thankful for no more taking pictures with her nose from her devices, I give this remote 5 stars.  Now all she needs is a tripod and her picture/video taking adventures will be immensely better.\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, and that is what I am providing. I have NOT been paid for this review. I will never shy away from listing negatives about products just because I received a discount or it was free; usually, I choose products that I am interested in trying already, and check out the reviews ahead of time to ensure it's something I will probably like, so many of my reviews are positive as a result of careful selection upfront, not because my positive reviews have been \"bought\" in any way. If there are negatives I notice about a product, you better bet I will list them!

I think it is the best quality mount have ever tried. I like it so much that I am using it in my car and it will hold my phone whenever I am in my car.\n\niKross 3in1 Dashboard Windshield Air Vent Holder was provided to me for testing and reviewing.

So, comparing this cable to other cables in the past, this is definitely the better choice. I have so many cheap cables lying around that are damaged, torn apart, or just cheap. But this cable is staying for a long time. It's staying because it was built with focus, ambition, and strength. It's staying because it was made to do more and be more. It was made for you and me. And it can only be bought here. And a slight bonus, the cable comes with a Velcro strap to hold the cable coiled if you're that kind of person.\n\nI have also tested the 6 foot micro USB cable. It is just as good as the 3 foot cable, but it came with TWO velcro straps!

The case seems very well made - all the cutouts are where they should be. The edges are firm and hard and the areas where I normally hold the phone are slightly rubberish to prevent the phone from easily slipping out of my hand, which is what I desire. The two volume and one power button are all very responsible.  The holster seems very solid as well, with the clip able to rotate 360 degrees.  The clip that holds the phone/case is along the long edge of the phone (as opposed to at the top) is a better design, IMO.  The plastic screen protector has a barely noticeable grid pattern to it and there seems to be bubbles where the plastic touches phone's scheen - unsure if these goes away over time. Looks ugly with the screen turned off (being black), but screen is on, it is not as noticeable.  Best of all the, the holes for both the headphone jack and micro USB power jack are big, all my micro USB power cables now fit !  The flaps that cover the two jacks are a nice touch for protection. The case fits very snug with the holster, and snaps in nicely.  Feel very nice.\n\nA few improvements.\n- allow users to easily remove the plastic screen protector.  For example, I already have a nice screen protector on mine - I may not want two layers\n- move the holster clip that holds the phone/case a little lower. It is currently right below the bottom edge of the power button (a little too close for my liking, but not a biggie, yet)\n- make the belt clip a very slightly wider to accommodate thicker belts (for example maybe make the gap 0.50 cm . For my thicker belt, the belt clip does not fully close all the way (almost there, just not perfect).\n\nMy first impression so far is that this is a very good value product - the next cases I will turn to first will be from SUPCASE.  Keep up the good work and do not become complacent - keep improving your products and keep prices reasonable.  No need to buy an Otter (and I had my share) - a SUPCASE would be just fine.\n\n*** A big thanks to all the folks who answered my question - it made a difference in my purchase.", "summary": "Very glad I bought this case.", "unixReviewTime": 1468627200}

But being careful is important if you wish to not crack it.\nI opened my case about 15-20 times before one of the clips finally broke.  The case still works, but one side of it is loose now.\n\nFinal thought: Buy this if you plan on rarely opening it up, don't buy it if you plan on removing your phone from the case often.", "summary": "it's ok", "unixReviewTime": 1261353600}

I got this case for the case itself and the holster clip. Upon getting this case I couldn't figure out how to get the case separated from the holster clip. Once I got the two separated...I found that the case fits this phone perfectly...absolutely perfect and doesn't add too much size to the phone overall as some cases do. You have the protection of a hybrid case with both plastic and rubber incorporated into the case. Now it came time to return the phone to the case...and oh boy what a struggle this was. In trying to clip it in was impossible and there was a fear of breaking the phone itself while trying to do so. Sliding it in proved to be equally troublesome as the rubber parts would get caught on the arms of the holster clip that made me believe I would tear that part. Removing the holster clip you could insert the phone by sliding it into the holster being able to guide the rubber past the arms of the holster safely, but that defeats the purpose of having the holster case if you have to take it off to pull the phone out or to put the phone back in. As if fate agreed...one of the arms of the holster clip broke...and my dad used his previous leather holster for the phone and case. It worked out...the case is great...can't say the same for the holster part.

I looked at what seemed like hundreds of cases before deciding on this one.\nPros:\n- This case looks great! Just as you would expect, the case has a minimalist design that doesn't take away from the sleek look of the iPhone. It is by far the best looking iPhone 6 Plus case I've seen.\n- It add very little bulk\n- You can see the back of the phone, but it's all protected. (Cases with a cut-out for the apple logo really bug me).\n- Appears to be made with high quality materials\n- Comes with a lifetime warranty, and you can't beat that!\nCons:\n- The \"bumper\" part of the case is a hard material. Personally, I would prefer a softer, more rubber-like bumper as I think it would a) provide more shock absorption and b) provide more of a grip on this slippery phone.\nOverall:\nI really love the look of this case, especially since the novelty of having a brand new phone is still going strong and the case really shows off the look of the phone. Right now, I am extremely careful with the phone having just paid full price for it. Eventually, however, I am going to have to face reality. I have two children under 4 years old that inevitably will get their sticky fingers on my phone. One day I will forget to place it on the high shelf and it will get tossed across the room like a baseball. Before that happens, I will likely need to look for a slightly more protective case.\nI would highly recommend this case as long as your phone is not likely to be assaulted by slimy, yogurt-covered little fingers and flung through the air.", "summary": "Best Looking Case", "unixReviewTime": 1416960000}

Also, another awesome feature to it is that when your electronic device has fully charged, the blue light will stop blinking and stay solid. This tells you that your device is fully charged and ready. When you get ready to charge this battery pack, since this is an powerful one, it is going to take about 8-10 hours to charge it, so the best thing is to charge it at night while you are sleeping, which okay with me.  When all four blue lights are solid, it will shut off after charging, so you don't have to worry about this device getting overheated.

Well this New Trent Travelpak is the best idea since sliced bread. It plugs directly into the wall outlet. I don't have to worry about another charger or cable or anything. I plug it in, it shows me how it is charging and when it is charged I take it out the next day. I charge my phone, my friends phone traveling with me, my headset, the list goes on and on. Then I pop it out and charge this in a wall outlet at the airport and keep going and going. I could never do that with another battery that used the same charger as my phone since I never would have time to charge both. Perfect item!", "summary": "Perfect travel charger", "unixReviewTime": 1372377600}

After reading the review left by Michael, I decided to go ahead and purchase this pouch. Finding a generic case/pouch was near impossible since the DX is a little bigger than most cell phones. I received the item yesterday and opened it right away. The first thing I did was slide my phone into the pouch and closed it to check for fit. My DX fit perfectly; if I shake the pouch, I do not feel the phone move at all; it's that snug! It is exactly what I wanted.\n\nTwo things I will note.\n1. The stitching on my pouch is not white, it's black. So to me, it looks even better than the one pictured.\n2. The little rectangular logo (REIKO)is not present on my pouch. It is actually impressed in the leather, making it much more visually appealing.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to DX owners!!\n\nUPDATE 10/12/2010:\nThe users that have reported that their Droid X will not fit in this case (or having to force their Droid X into the case) are definitely not reviewing the same case that I received. The pictures that are shown for product view are of my actual case as well as my actual Droid X. If you receive your case and it has a tag that indicates \"iPhone\" anywhere on the tag, DO NOT OPEN IT! Return it to Amazon and have them correct it. Also, do a visual inspection before opening. The Droid X and HTC Evo are large and will not fit most cell phone cases. Put your phone up to it and visually compare the size of the case to the size of your phone.

Due to its nice size it takes up just one slot on a power strip. It is 2\"L x 2\"W x 1\"H and weighs 2.8 oz. The package includes a travel pouch.\n\nI tested Pawtec wall charger with Samsung Nexus phone and iPad Mini tablet.\n\nI run the same set on tests on each battery pack I own, so I can compare them to each other using \"apples to apples\" comparison. This set of tests allows me to compare different chargers as well as see how performance changes with each upgrade of the operating system. I am including the details of the tests below for those who want to see the nitty gritty.\n\nFor those who are interested in the bottom line this battery pack worked consistently with both devices and charged the devices charging them at slightly below average rate.\n\n To prolong battery life\n==================================\n\nLi-ion batteries do not need to be fully charged nor is it desirable to do so. In fact, it is better not to fully charge, because high voltages stresses the battery. Li-ion should never be discharged too low. This is why battery manufacturers typically ship batteries with a 40 percent charge. The low charge state reduces aging-related stress while allowing some self-discharge during storage. If you plan to store the battery without using it apply a partial charge before a long storage period.\n\n How I tested this wall charger\n==================================\n\nI use a USB current monitor and a charging test to test each port. The current monitor shows the voltage and the current flowing between the battery and the device.\n\nI started running these tests when my Android devices had HoneyComb operating system so I was able to observe the improvements in charging with different version of the Android OS. Before 4.21 I could only get fast charging on 1A port, and would get bad performance on 2.1A port on my Android devices. After upgrade to Jelly Bean 4.21 I see the same performance on 2A and 1A ports as it is controlled by the device negotiating the protocol with the charger. Google reverse engineered the Apple protocol and now my Android devices typically charge similar in speed on both ports of a good charger. This is not true for Apple devices. They do better on ports designed for Apple (2.1A ports).\n\nAn addition variable for Android devices is whether a data cable or charging cable is used to charge the device. The charging cables short the two data connections together (rendering them useless for data transfer), but this fools devices to see the cable as an AC power connection, and thus accept the higher current of the charging source.\n\nThe 10 minutes test consists of charging each mobile device on each port of the battery pack for 10 minutes and measure how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. Since the charging speed is non-linear I start charging each device from approximately the same charge level. I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.\n\n Test Results:\n======================\n\n Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone\n--------------------------\nPort 1: AC charging rate ----- 4% change in charge in 10 minutes\nPort 1: current monitor: ~~~~~ 0.95A and 5.12V\n\nPort 2: AC charging rate ----- 4% change in charge in 10 minutes\nPort 2: current monitor: ~~~~~ 0.96A and 5.12V\n\n iPad Mini Tablet\n--------------------------\nPort 1: AC charging rate ----- 1% change in charge in 10 minutes\nPort 1: current monitor: ~~~~~ 1.46A and 5.10V\n\nPort 2: AC charging rate ----- 3% change in charge in 10 minutes\nPort 2: current monitor: ~~~~~ 1.53A and 5.12V\n\n Summary\n------------------\nThis is a small 2 port charger. Its charging rate is somewhat below average, but it works well for overnight charging and when compact size matters I like it. It takes up just one slot on the old fashioned power strip, and since I am always running out of space on my power strips this is a big plus for this charger.\n\nThis charger is provided by Pawtec.\n\nAli Julia review", "summary": "Takes up only one slot on a power strip", "unixReviewTime": 1395187200}

One of the biggest issues I had is that after a week or so, the ports would become really loose and your devices would only charge if you got the adapter in the perfect position. Just from opening the package and holding this adapter, I can tell that it is much better quality than ones I have used in the past.\n\nThere are a lot of car chargers out there, but what makes this one worth buying?:\n\nPros:\n1) There are 3 USB ports\n2) Of the three ports, one is 2.1amps, one is 2.0amps, and the other is 1.0amps. That means you can charge BOTH an iPad/tablet AND a phone at the same time\n3) Mat grey finish is applied where cables are unplugged a lot to keep from scratching. (yes this is just a cosmetic feature, but it makes everyone feel better when there electronics don't get scratched!)\n4) EXTREMELY SMALL\n\nCons:\n1) No replaceable fuse\n\nThis car charger simply does what it states. It will charge any device through USB while your 12V plug on your car is on. It provides users with the ability to use GPS aps in their car without completely draining there battery when they get to their destination\n\nWould you buy it for a friend/recommend it?\nWITHOUT A DOUBT!!

This is a sorry offering from Motorola and their quality appears to be in decline.\n\nMy first moto headset (don't remember the number) was cheap but fine. I then decided to upgrade to an H790 which wasn't cheap but not too expensive. It lasted for a few years of light but regular use and finally the speaker gave out. (harsh treble and difficult to understand voices) The microphone and speaker quality were excellent for a long time, and no issues with the battery life even to this day.\n\nNow enter the Motorola HK250. The sound was okay, the microphone mediocre at best, but it was inexpensive. After less than a month of use, it is now a brick. This is unacceptable even at this price point.\n\nIt had been left dormant (turned off and battery level \"high\") for a few days and now does nothing when you turn it on. Putting it on the charger resulted in a rapidly blinking red light, for which there is no definition on their relatively pathetic and useless \"light status chart\". Motorola has yet to reply as to how you can tell if it's fully charged by the single multi-colored light on the face. I do already know what the rapidly blinking red light and no functionality mean.\n\nEven if I get it replaced on warranty I'd never trust it as a primary device. I might not feel this way had it failed a bit sooner. My guess is either a garbage battery or they skimped on the charge system components.\n\nUpdate: I found no way to initialize a ticket on Motorola's website without creating an account.

The clear version differs from some other similar cases sold here at Amazon in that it has a frosted bezel rather than the optically clear bezel some other cases have. In addition, the protection this case sports has a bit more cushion than cases which superficially seem identical or at least similar.\n\nClear cases have advantages over opaque, colored cases. The obvious one is that they preserve the color scheme of your iPhone. Why ask for a silver cased iPhone only to hide it in an orange or green case? Less obvious, using a clear case, you can set your phone to LED flash on alerts (Settings, General, Accessibility, Flash LED on Alerts). In action, the entire bezel of the case flashes when the phone tries to alert you. This is not only decorative, but means you won't miss an alert due to your volume being way down or the phone on mute. Personally, I think it just looks great.\n\nI've inadvertently dropped the iPhone several times onto a wood floor and once onto a concrete driveway while in this case with no damage whatsoever to the phone.

Cambridge", "reviewText": "I just received my new BlueAnt Z9i in the mail yesterday and couldn't wait to get it open and on my ear!  I love new toys!  Let me give just a little background.\n\nI bought the original Z9 back in March of this year and loved it.  It was my first Bluetooth headset.  I had no problems pairing it with my Motorola Razr.  However, there were some subsequent connection issues, such as taking too long to go from 'idle' to 'standby' and some dropping issues which were probably due to some kind of interference.  I still haven't figured the latter out.\n\nI'm also the proud new owner of an iPhone 3G that I just got three days ago.  So I had a couple of days to try out my Z9 with the new iPhone and see if some of the issues I had with the Razr would still be the same with the iPhone.  I'm glad to say that after just a couple of days using the Z9 with the iPhone, the 'weak signal' notifications I was getting with my Razr are non-existent with the iPhone.\n\nSo, now for the Z9i.  In just a day of use, I like some of the new features already.  The first is the change from the old to the new in how to disconnect a call.  On the original Z9, in order ot hang up a call, I had to hold the MFB for three seconds.  On the new Z9i, a single click will do the same.  It also seems to connect faster than the Z9.\n\nOne thing I have noticed that I don't like is the intermittent 'empty room echo' sound that I've been hearing on occasion.  It's hard to say if it's the iPhone or the Z9i.  I haven't had that problem with the original Z9 paired with the iPhone in the two days I had them together.  I'll have to do some more testing and investigating.\n\nHaving used the original for several months, I was already comfortable with the fit and form and have no complaints with the new one.  I like the fact that BlueAnt ships an additional earpiece.  The original didn't come with an extra.\n\nOverall this is a great sounding earpiece.  It's small and lightweight - the reasons I bought the original.  The noise isolation is great - not really sure why they have 'standard' and 'max' isolation modes, but they both work very well.  The battery life is very good.  Because I use it everyday, I have to charge it often.\n\nOne other thing that I forgot to mention was the wind test.  I have yet to test it in windy conditions.  The original Z9 was 'OK' when I was going down the highway at cruising speed with the windows down AND TALKING.  The microphones worked great at isolating my voice and cutting out the background noise.  However, when I stopped talking to listen to the other party, they could hear all of the whooshing from the wind because that's all the Z9 picked up.  Very annoying for the person I would be talking to.  I'll post an update for the Z9i a little later on.", "summary": "Better than the original... so far.", "unixReviewTime": 1216857600}

Its definitely a flip phone. I found one of a similar make in the childrens toy box. The old one is silver and has smaller keys though. One of the things that I liked about those phones was that they were a lot harder to make butt calls from. The bright red coloring makes it much easier to find when it is sitting on a desk or out on any surface, like my kitchen counter, which is grey tile.\n\nI had a few medical questions that I often forget to ask my doctor or that I cant ask because I am not the one who takes the relevant child in, so I did think this service could be useful. For me though, from the time the first operator answered the phone and said she was sending emergency services, all of that was just too much for me. And really, in retrospect, where were they going to send emergency services? So, yes, they did start asking a lot of questions but I wanted to ask the questions. It began to feel very intrusive, before I could even speak to a nurse.\n\nMy husband often has questions that he doesnt want to email his doctor about and I thought he might be willing to talk to the people on this service  and in fact it would be well worth the monthly cost. However, his health problems are complex enough he thinks he should just email his own doctors office. Im like, But you dont.\n\nThe expense of this service would make it worthwhile if someone were able to use the phone service. I can see a lot of situations where it would be useful.\n\nDONT get this phone for the games. LOL!", "summary": "Blast from the past", "unixReviewTime": 1405987200}

This case makes it feel WAY more durable. It is very snug and gives a very re-assuring solid feel to the phone. I am no longer worried about scratching or gouging it, or breaking the back glass when I set it down. I don't know how well it would survive a fall (definitely better than the naked case would), but I don't feel like I have to baby it all the time, which was the one thing I didn't like about the phone.\n\nWhile I prefer the soft-touch plastic on some of their other products, this plastic/rubber has a very nice grippy feel to it. I'm never worried about the phone slipping out of my hand as I was with the naked case. As another pleasant surprise, it seems to be completely impervious to fingerprints! I mean, I can't even put fingerprints on it deliberately. The Volume/Power buttons are fully enclosed and have solved my previous gripe about the buttons being too sensitive...now they are perfect. Very clicky and responsive, but not so responsive that they activate just by brushing against them like before.\n\nThe cut outs are all where they need to be, and some actually enhance the device. The fingerprint reader is actually a lot easier to use for me with the case on. The USB-C port is plenty big enough to accommodate all the cables I use...I don't struggle trying to plug it in. The case is also easy to put on and take off, despite fitting so snuggly.\n\nI do like the styling, but would have preferred more minimalism...The matte plastic finish looks really nice IMO, but I'm not as big a fan of the faux carbon-fiber insert things. I don't hate them, but I'd have preferred something that matches the rest of the case. And like everyone else, I could do without the Spigen logo on the back.\n\nOtterbox used to be my preferred case, but honestly, I think I am loyal to Spigen now.

I can also say, from experience, the case also protects the phone impacts if dropped while the finish of the case remains pretty durable. Please note: I can say this even after (clumsily and most embarrassingly) dropping my phone on tile, concrete and asphalt.\n\nThe only negative I could see is that this case was nearly impossible to remove initially and is still TRULY difficult to remove. This, however, is not much of a problem if you do not use a dock. I remove my case only to clean my phone because I use a cable to charge and sync.

I really love the sturdiness and functionality of this case.\nAnother thing I like is the case adds some grip to the phone. Without a case the phone is real slick and easily can slide out of your hand, already has for me a couple of times when I first received it, but with the rubber border of the rugged case it makes it easier to hold.\nThe cover on the back does not interfere with the camera like some cases do and the flash and heart rate monitor are also easily accessed. The cover over the speakers does protect it little better but seems to muffle the sound very slightly.\nThe cover is very easy to install on the phone and fits securely, yet is not impossible to remove if needed.\nThe built in screen protector does slightly alter the touch, which I really like because the S5s screen is very sensitive, almost too sensitive, so for me the phone works flawlessly in the case.\nLastly I will mention that I had placed a Qi Charging tab under the original Samsung back cover when I first purchased the phone, as I did not like opening the USB cover all the time, and I was worried that the rugged cover may interfere with the ability to charge, and I am happy to say that there is not any issue, it charges as well with the Trentius cover in place as without the cover.\nBuy it, and be happily protected.\nPros-\nStylish for a full cover\nrigid / slim protection\ncolored changeable back plates\nscreen protector is fingerprint friendly\n\nCons-\nDust collection under screen cover - but easy to clean", "summary": "Rugger Ultra-Thin Case, another Excellent Quality Product from New Trent", "unixReviewTime": 1407369600}

I resisted switching to another brand for a slew of reasons, none of which were all that valid--at least not when I look back on it now. The Palm platform was nothing if not user-friendly...I've said it before: those who designed the Palm OS simply must have assumed it would be used by simpletons who were barely above the deep-thinking of your average Neanderthal. My wife & daughter both have Blackberry Curves, and after playing with them on and off, I further refused to consider anything other than Palm because I couldn't figure it out all that quickly. But things change...but I certainly did NOT want to, I can assure you that.\n\nAbout 6-8 months ago, my Palm 755p began giving me trouble. It wasn't very frequent--at first...but after a few weeks of spontaneous re-starts, some at the most unwanted times, I really began to become annoyed. Working in radio, I did a live broadcast remote at a wireless location and started to seriously consider a Windows Mobile phone (in this case, it was a Moto Q9c). I began to slowly research the Moto Q and Windows Mobile phones in particular on the web and also here at amazon.com. What I discovered was other than a select few, the majority of reviews from Windows users were by and large disappointed with their phones. The common thread wasn't the quality of the phones, but the stability of the Operating System itself.\n\nThis lead me to consider Blackberry...reluctantly, but a kernal of hope took root and before long, my Treo's problems put me on the fast track to getting a phone that only months before I had vowed never to purchase. I would've loved to get another Palm, but having played with the Centro, I found the keyboard actually TOO small for me to comfortably use--and I don't have big fingers, so I think that says a lot right there. I considered a Windows phone made by Palm, but gave up after reading way too many complaints about the OS screwing up way too much. The upcoming Palm Pre looks VERY promising, but my Treo simply wasn't going to last long enough, so I took the plunge.\n\nThe Bold is out of the box, striking. It's wider than my Treo but MAN is it thinner by a rather large amount--nearly half I'd say.  The keyboard is quite a bit different in several ways...let me explain: some of the icons and symbols are in entirely different locations than what I had become used to with my Treo 650, 700p and subsequent 755p. I thought it would take FOREVER to get used to that, but surprisingly it didn't at all. Also, the keyboard takes advantage of the wider real estate and is spread out further...but the REAL difference (IMO) is my Palm keys were more individual and separated and way higher than on the Bold. Now THIS took some getting used to. On my Palm it was rather easy, even without looking to move my fingers from one key to the next and simply know from that touch alone that I was on a different key. This is not the case with the Bold keyboard. It bothered me--at first, but after a few days, I have become attuned to the difference and it no longer bothers me like it initially did.\n\nThe next major change is the screen...and boy is this a mighty HUGE change. First off, I have become rather accustomed to using a touch-screen now for quite some time...it was one of my biggest problems with switching to Blackberry. I briefly considered the Storm, but after playing with the virtual keyboard, I ruled that out entirely. I MUST have a keyboard--the virtual one's just don't cut it for me. The other thing is the 100% Upgrade the screen turned out to be compared with the Treo. I've read about it quite a bit and I gotta tell you, until you see it yourself, words almost cannot do it justice. This screen is unbelievably brilliant. Frickin' incredible. It's a bit wider and a tad shorter than my Palm but the display certainly looked 2 to 3 times brighter and way more clear. Off the charts a MUCH better screen. I have yet to see its equal. I cannot tell you how many times I went--out of habit--to grab the stylus in order to tap it on the screen only to realize my phone no longer has one. I hear rumor that RIM is coming out with a Bold-like phone with a keyboard and touch screen...now THAT will be a phone to look out for...but back to my Bold...\n\nI'll be honest, it is quite a change switching to an Operating System so dramatically different than the moronically simple one employed by Palm. Breaking old habits seem to be harder the older I get. Where Palm was intuitive and just plain obvious, Blackberry has been difficult and almost imposible to figure out. I chalk this up to my stubborness more than anything else...but the fact remains: the OS of my Blackberry suffers in comparison to how ridiculously easy Palm phones are to use and figure out. While I am STILL working on getting used to my phone, it DOES have some nifty features NOT found in any Palm device (yet)...for instance, the one thing that sets Blackberry's apart from EVERYTHING else out there is e-mail. This certainly is one place where the Bold not only beats Palm, but embarasses it entirely. The set-up was easy enough that even my Grandma could figure it out and within less than 10 minutes, I had 4 separate e-mail accounts up and running without a hitch. Too easy and it is definitely where the Bold shines (other than the screen).\n\nThe trackball also takes some getting used to. It's nice that you can adjust the sensitivity of the ball, (much like using a mouse) so if you like to scroll quickly, you can, or if you'd like a bit more control, don't worry, you can do that, too. Another place where the Bold wins hands down is the speaker. It actually has TWO separate speakers which delivers actual stereo sound, quite loudly, I might add. Another really nifty thing if you ask me. It paired up with my Bluetooth quite easily and the sound quality from what those on the other end have told me is noticeably better than on my Palm (which was notorious for having Bluetooth issues).\n\nOne thing I honestly wish Blackberry did differently is allow the phone to ring and vibrate at the same time. I always figured my wife just couldn't figure it out herself for why her's never did...but as it turns out the phone will vibrate first, and THEN ring. You cannot switch it to do both simultaneously...why, I simply have no clue. The addition of WiFi is a nice added bonus. At work I can surf using the wireless network at my office, also at home and at several friends houses out in the country where service is spotty. Another major advantage over Palm...although in fairness many newer Palms have built-in WiFi...but NONE of the models I have used ever did. 3G service is pretty nice, too...but my Treo 700p and 755p were both EVDO equipped, which are essentially the same thing, so no big difference there. Downloading websites and attachments via email online is a breeze.\n\nA couple places where Blackberry can take a cue from Palm (and I realize there aren't that many) are the lack of a switch on the outside that allows you to turn off the ringer instantly without using the screen. I also wish the button to turn on the speaker during a call was situated on the screen and activated via the trackball rather than having to push the tiny $ key on front...it just seems a bit harder to find, even in the dark with the backlight on. A small annoyance, but a valid one all the same.\n\nWhile I have heard many complain about the clarity of the camera, I gotta tell you its WAY better than the measly 1.3 mega-pixel standard on the Palms I've used. I snapped a photo of my little son and sent it to my wife's Blackberry Curve and she wrote back wondering where I had got the photo never once considering it had come from my phone. Sure it'd be nice to have a 3.2 mp camera like on the Storm and 8900, but all in all I am satisfied--especially having come from the inferior Treo camera. The video recorder is noticeably of less quality than the camera is, which strikes me a little odd, but I don't usually videotape much using my phone, so I don't really see that to be a problem for me--but you never know.\n\nAll in all, I gotta admit--and while it was a LONG time in coming, the Blackberry has won me over. The lack of almost ANY advance in the Palm OS over the course of over 10 years is pretty inexcusable if you ask me. Seriously, my original Palm organizer (no phone) looks relatively unchanged (other than color vs monochrome) from my old Treo 755p. Sure there are a few cosmetic changes in that time, but overall, the OS looks essentially exactly the same as it did from the beginning. That certainly made it easy to figure out when you upgraded over your previous model, but come ON...really? That is much too long to hold onto an outdated OS. The upcoming Pre certainly looks way cool and is an obvious 100% upgrade on the OS, but it just may be a little too late for some--it certainly was for me.\n\nIf you are a die-hard Palm user frantically becoming disillusioned with your phone, its time to seriously consider moving on and putting the old away in exchange for something enirely new...just be prepared to take a while to get used to it...knowing that alone will make the conversion much easier to handle.\n\nKudos to Blackberry on such a fine product. Conversion complete.\n\n*****UPDATE*****\n\nI am STILL working on getting used to Blackberry's entirely different Operating System. I find myself continually reaching for a stylus that isn't there, but I am slowly adjusting to a non-touch-screen phone (emphasis on s-l-o-w-l-y).\n\nThe battery...? Well, let's just say as long as you have WiFi turned off, it's reasonably okay...which is to say on par with my Treo 755p...well, maybe a shade better, but not by much.\n\nThe trackball...? Surfing on the Web using the trackball is MUCH less efficient than being able to use a stylus (or my finger). I find when I want to scroll down to the bottom of a particularly large page, it can seem like forever having to scroll down so slowly. I wish it were differently--and who knows? Maybe there is a work-around that I am unaware of...\n\nThe e-mail set up and usage is simply FIRST RATE I have to admit. I haven't bothered to check my e-mail using my computer in several weeks now because I simply don't NEED to. I still send e-mail using my computer because even with the QWERTY keyboard, actually writing a message is still easier using a regular-sized keyboard...but I do find myself not even trying to access e-mail online much...thanks Bold!\n\nWiFi IS VERY convenient! The only minor gripe I have is that when I am in an area with less than stellar AT&T coverage, I turn on WiFi and the phone STILL tries to use the almost non-existent signal to go online. I naturally assumed that the phone would use the strongest signal available, but as it turns out, that isn't the case. Now that I have that figured out, it's simply a case of figuring out where my signal strengths are and remember to turn off and on WiFi and phone receiver. Yes, it IS a bit of a problem, but my Alltel 755p had poor reception where my bedroom is and I was plain SOL if I wanted to check something online--at least NOW I have an option, however inconvenient it may be (I assure you, this is a minor gripe at best).\n\nThe mp3 player is incredibly easy to use--unfortunately the built-in equalizer isn't all that great and the volume isn't quite what I'd like it to be--but seeing as I have managed to mis-place (lost) my Sansa Clip mp3 player, this is at least a nice alternative that otherwise wasn't available.\n\nI downloaded Transformers and Eagle Eye recently and I MUST say, this is yet one more place where the stunning screen simply SHINES beyond the competition. Add to that the fantastic stereo speakers, and watching feature-length movies in the palm of my hand couldn't be more cool & simple.\n\nI DO wish the button to turn on the speakerphone was a bit easier to locate and turn on...once again, adding a button to access the speaker ON the screen with the trackball, well that would be a giant leap forward for this device if you ask me.\n\nI am still finding it difficult to access a couple of books I downloaded using Mobi Pocket (ie I cannot access them at all), but otherwise, I am still impressed and VERY happy.", "summary": "Former Palm user Free @Last with Blackberry conversion", "unixReviewTime": 1240876800}

Then I peel off the protector from it's backing, slap it on the phone and align it just right.  Bring the the squeegee and squeegee off the excess water, trying to mostly avoid the holes (earpiece, etc...) in the phone and then dry it off with a cloth.\n\nI then let the phone sit over night still turned off and it's ready to go in the morning.  The screen looks pretty bad for the first 24 - 48 hours, but once all the liquid evaporates through the protector materiel, it is usually clear as glass and I've not yet had any real problem with dust.  If I had a complaint about wet application protectors is that they don't feel nearly as nice as glass and some dry application protectors.  This is really a minor quibble, but the rubbery material that these Skinomi protectors are made of kind of drags on the finger when you are sliding around the screen.  It's not bad, but not nearly as kinesthetically pleasing as sliding around the glass.  As I said, it's a minor quibble on an otherwise excellent product.  The fit on the Nexus 5 is spot on - I was a little concerned that it did not have cutouts for the light sensor and mass sensors (but it does for the speaker), but it doesn't seem to affect the performance of either sensor, so I guess they aren't necessary.\n\nOverall, an excellent product and I heartily recommend these to anyone looking for a screen protector.  Don't let the wet application scare you away, it's not really that hard and the fit and finish of the final product once installed is vastly superior to any dry application screen protector I have ever used (and I've used plenty!).", "summary": "Looks great, easy to apply!", "unixReviewTime": 1384128000}

The processing power is pretty good, although the speed is not blazing, as the specs would indicate.  The music player is very good, particularly if you use a high-quality headset instead of the speaker or the stock headset.

It might take a while to learn all of the features of the phone, since the settings and instructions are not entirely clear.  The battery lasts more than 24 hours with medium use.  The phone is pleasantly thin and light.  The included case is a nice touch.\n\nThe Negatives  The extra strip at the bottom is very annoying, aesthetically and operationally. The screen rotation does not always work, and sometimes it is sluggish; although most of the time it is pretty quick.

From cell phones to tablets almost all of us has at least one item that takes this type of cable, but what about those times where you need a quick charge? A power bank is a great option that I recommend having with you at all times, but then you have to deal with lugging not only the power bank, but also an exceedingly long USB cord around all day. It can be hard to find a Micro USB cable that is not only short but offers a good charge speed ensuring you aren't stuck at the end of a power bank for hours at a time. Luckily, PowerBot created a small yet capable device that pairs perfectly with a power bank.\n\nThe PowerBot PB302 is actually quite surprisingly small, at only about 6 inches it takes up little to no space in the packaging it comes in. The packaging itself is done very well, so well as a matter of fact, that it can actually be hard to take out of the packaging! The cardboard packaging keeps the cord snug in its plastic encasing. Once opened, (a tough but do-able job) I was caught a bit off guard. I was expecting something a bit stiff, that would keep its position once used. Once I got my hands on it I noticed an almost gelatinous movement when held. This is a positive for people who would like this to be as portable as possible, as you do not need to worry about this mechanism breaking over time.\n\nSince I had the PowerBot 7 port charger, I decided to give the SB302 a try by charging my tablet (An Asus 7 inch tablet). It worked well and I did get the full benefit from the cord as the charging speed came in at right around 2 amps. This number will, however, change depending on the quality of your charger. Most power banks will charge your phone at a half of an amp, so this method will take considerably longer no matter what you choose as your USB cord of choice.\n\nFortunately, the PowerBot PB302 is also a sync cable; meaning this can transfer files from your phone to your PC and vice versa. I do not see myself using this method too much in the future, the transfer speed was great, but a long cable is infinitely more comfortable to use when transferring files from a large PC.\n\nOverall, the PowerBot PB302 is a great choice as a Micro USB cable for a power bank. It can be twisted, tied, and blatantly thrown about at will without worry because of the high-quality rubber it is made out of, the USB and Micro USB ports are also of high quality with little-to-no wiggle room inside of its encasing. However, if you are like me who charges your phone every night and does not need a small USB cable for a power bank, I do not see the practicality of this USB cable. If you are a person who needs a quick boost every now and again, I would advise you to check this PowerBot PB302 out on Amazon as it will not only save you time when it is needed but also money when it comes to choosing the right USB cable for your needs.\n\n I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.", "summary": "The PowerBot PB302 is a great choice as a Micro USB cable for a power bank", "unixReviewTime": 1446249600}

This is a better-than-nothing level of protection, mostly to prevent scrapes and gouges from a drop. It does offer protection, but probably the least amount you can get with a case. There is no gel inner layer, so it is basically like having a stock phone with a really think back plate. So if you are the clumsy type prone to dropping your phone, I'd suggest going with a case a little more robust. There is a lip that raises the display off the surface from the sides, but you can still see the rounded edges of the display, and it looks really cool. Camera port, Mic ports, charge port, and headphone jacks are all easily accessed. Though it doesn't offer a heavy amount of protection, it's not as necessary on the Nexus 6, since Motorola did an awesome job making the phone hard to break.\n\nI absolutely love the soft touch plastic, which is similar to the covering on the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7. It cleans easily, is resistant to fingerprints, and is much more grippy than the stock coating or other hard cases. Really, this is how the case of the phone itself should feel, and the phone looks better with this case on and is a pleasure to hold. I love the minimalistic and high tech look it imparts to the phone. I could have done without the Spigen logo on the back, but at least it is also in black.

It took a bullet for my phone several times, at least 3 or 4 times I dropped it. My Nexus 5 display never shattered, and even today looks to be in mint condition thanks to the case.

My husband bought these to replace the ones that came with our Galaxy S5 phones.  We needed to replace them because the cats promptly chewed them up (we do not have this problem with any of our other cords or cables).  If the Samsung logo wasn't enough to convince me of the authenticity of this product, the fact that the cats chewed these immediately lends credence to their veracity.  I don't know what it is about the coating, but 2 out of 3 cats can not resist it.  We tried spraying the cords with bitter cherry, that worked for a day or two. The only real solution has been covering their entire length with electrical tape or use a different cable.  Thus far none of the cats have been visibly harmed, but they have chewed completely through these cords.\n\nThis is a perfect replacement for any S-5 owner.  The product description says that they will will fully charge the phone in about 3 hours.  I find that mine can go for 2% to 100% in about an hour.  It's really kind of awesome because charging my old S3 seemed to take forever.  These are not a universal cable.  They will no work with the S3 or any other device with a standard Micro USB input.  I find the 5-foot cable to be a perfect length.  I use my phone as an alarm clock, so there's plenty of room to go from the outlet to the night stand.\n\n(Pro Tip: If for some reason you are hospitalized, ask the nurse for a piece of tape.  Tape your charger to your bedside table with a little bit of a tail.  You'll be much happier, and the nurses will think you're a genius.)\n\nI would buy these again in a heartbeat, but alas- I'm afraid of electrocuting the cats.  I only put these in the car, which doesn't have quite as great of an impact.  Also, I can't use this cable when I use my FM Transmitter.  There's way too much engine whine.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who doesn't have Samsung-cord-seeking cats.

I like that it comes in a pack of 6 in case you mess up installation or it scratches and you have replacements on hand. Only knocked a star because the film seems thin. It should hold up to normal lighter scratches and protect the watch, but probably not on anything harder than that.\n\nThe install is super easy on the Sony SW3, I don't know why people are complaining. The watch is waterproof. So all you have to do is spray the s*** out of the adhesive side and the face of the watch and then position it to how you want it. Once everything lines up, start pushing out the water with the squeegee/card from the center. Super easy.\n\nupdate: 2/11/16\n\nI'm on my third one already. It's doing a great job protecting my watch screen as there are no scratches. It seems that it can't really heal from scuffs. But it does find with light scratches. Other than that, I have no problems with it. For those that are wondering, I find that putting the watch on the stand that came with the watch makes it super easy to install.

Harris", "reviewText": "I ordered this, on a Saturday, received it on a Wednesday!\nThe reason I ordered it, was because another \"flagship killer\" was unable to produce enough fo their \"killer\" phones to meet demand.\nVery high quality packaging, arrived in good condition.  Turning it on, the battery was at 46%.  I just set it up using wi-fi, synced my\napps, set up email etc without issue.  I don't know what people are worrying about, with it \"only\" being a 720p screen, it looks fantastic\nsitting next to my now retired Galaxy note1.  The size is NOT that bad either.  Spec wise, my note1 and this are pretty much the\nsame width & thickness, and only around 1/2\" longer, but, with those reduced bezels on the Mate2, that gives me 8/10th of an inch\nMORE screen size!  Screen is bright & clear, no bad pixels.  I shaved my standard size sim card down to fit it, came right up in H+\nmode (shows 4g on the display).  Need to stop by Walmart (I'm on straight talk) and get a new sim so the LTE light will come on.\nI use bluetooth, and never the handset microphone or speaker, bluetooth is CRYSTAL clear, better than my note.  The ring, sounds and other speaker sound is VERY loud.  This one came with 4.3, which isn't a deal killer for me, it's an upgrade from 4.1.2 that I was using.\nI don't use the built in launcher, but opt for Nova since that is what I'm use to.\nNow, for that HUGE battery!  Left this morning at 100% charged.  After a couple hours of phone usage, few dozen emails, web surfing, text messaging, I still have around 90% left!  It might take me a few days just to run the battery down, which is one of the main reasons I got this.\nI hate running out of juice.\nThe camera, has some nifty features and the image quality is top notch.  The built in software is pretty good, but I'm use to Camera FV-5, and the macro mode works pretty darn good!\nHuawei hit one out of the park, in my opinion.  If you like big screens, you'll love this!\n\nUpdate, still going strong over a year after purchase.  Huawei did update the device late June 2015, to LL5.1, and also provided an easy way to go back to JB4.3 if you didn't like it.  First version of LL does have a couple minor bugs.  If you switch the launcher, text messaging etc, from the default to a 3rd party app, once you power off/on, it goes back to the Mate2 default apps.  If you are like me and never turn your device off, it's no big deal.  The other minor bug is they need to tweak it a bit.  It is using just a little more battery than before, but nothing that impacts that 2 day battery life.  If I had to do it all over again, I would STILL get this phone, it's a winner!", "summary": "Best Bang for the buck!", "unixReviewTime": 1404950400}

In retrospect, I should have also bought the SD card that comes pre-loaded with an Operating System (OS) because I spent numerous hours trying to create my own SD card, first using a Windows PC.  When that failed, I tried on a MAC.  No success either.\n\nI understand and accept that this product is for tinkerers so I do not regret all the time spent.  However, I did not expect to have to be an experienced \"geek\" with basic understanding of the DOS commands to create the SD card.  I guess this is exactly the goal of the Raspberry Pi: get people to learn the inside workings of a basic computer.\n\nSo I reluctantly returned the product.  Yes, I could have purchased the preloaded SD card but my sense of pride got in the way.  I swallowed that pride and concluded that, if I could not get started with booting properly, I was not destined to do much with the Pi afterwards.", "summary": "I give it a neutral 3 stars because I was not able to test potential.

This wasn't a big deal to me considering I had extras to try again later.\n\nAfter going out one night, I came home and discovered the film had come off completely while I was out and hadn't realized it.\n\n2ND INSTALLATION:\nFor the 2nd time, I applied the film again, this time much more successfully.  I gave myself a couple of days to allow the film to dry and cure without powering the watch back on to ensure the best result.  This time, the film looked much better than the 1st attempt-- smoother finish, no bubbles or peeled up corners.\n\nUnfortunately about a week later, I noticed a corner starting to peel up. After a day or two, I just peeled it off completely and have not applied a replacement film since.\n\nI think the problem with this product is the inability to strongly adhere to the rounded edges of the watch screen.  Couple that with the amount of unintended contact the watch face has with the outside environment and that will lead to having to replace it more frequently than you might imagine.\n\nI enjoy Skinomi's products, but I wouldn't necessarily worry about getting this product for your Apple Watch.", "summary": "Peels Off Too Easily...Wouldn't Recommend", "unixReviewTime": 1447632000}

You know what you need? A case for it. Something that adds to the phone's sleek aesthetics. Something that looks modern and sharp.

This may be the coolest looking phone case I've ever had. It is made entirely out of a hard rubber, with the outside edge being reinforced and raised to protect the screen.\n\nThat said, if protection is really your goal, then splurge for a more expensive waterproof lock box type of case.

Feels great in the hand, and \"dat silicone\" in the corners.  I actually like to bounce the phone on the corners (1-2\" drops, nothing that would be considered a drop).  It has a nice little bounce.  This is my third SG case, and all of them have been awesome.  Fit and finish is perfect.  I used the screen protector for a few weeks, but didn't like the haze it put on the screen, and kind of made the screen look like an oil slick in the rain.  The case does add a fair amount of bulk, so if you prefer a minimalistic case, this is not the case for you.  If you want the ultimate in protection for your phone, this is it.  I never used the holster that came with it, but it did seem durable, and well made.  If you are a holster user, you won't be disappointed.  If you put the phone in your pocket with the screen facing your leg, you will end up pulling your pocket inside out.  If you put it in your pocket with the screen facing out, it's much better.  Still tugs at the pocket a little, but nowhere near as much.\n\nThe only complaint I'll make about this case, which prevents a 5 star review, are the silicone flaps over the charge port, and headphone jack.  They don't stay closed very well, and stick out a little from the case.

Patocka", "reviewText": "I purchased an LG Power for use on Straight Talk a few weeks ago.  Looking in the store where I was purchasing the phone, I couldn't find any cases, so I jumped online and found quite a selection.  Granted, many of the cases that you find are of one particular design or style with several different colors or printed designs on them to choose from.  I wanted a case that was sleek, without a belt clip, that would offer a decent level of protection.  I think I found it with this purchase.  The rubber sleeve fits the phone perfectly, and the snap on, 2 piece front and back cover has a nice gunmetal gray color to it.  The outer case snaps on easily and fits snug.  You have access to all ports on the phone and cutouts on the rear that offer protection but don't limit mobility.  I really can't complain about what this case can offer you, especially for the $10 or under price you can currently purchase it.  It also included a free stylus and screen cover, but I'm not using either as I had already purchased a cover for this phone but hey, I won't turn down any free extras.  When I showed my wife the cover after putting it on the phone she thought I had purchased an Otterbox.  I've owned Otterbox covers before on other phones and I'd say my newest cover comes darn close to the level of protection my past Otterbox covers have offered.  One element of the design that I really enjoy is the extra space the cover occupies in your hands when you hold the phone horizontally to text.  The added thickness makes this phone even more ergonomic to use.  Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.  Final note, the cover has small indentations on the right side making the separation of the front and back covers a simple, pain-free process.", "summary": "If you have an LG Power, look no further for the perfect case!", "unixReviewTime": 1441152000}

Not only does it protect my phone from drops, it also provides a good grip on the smartphone. The built-in kickstand is very useful for watching videos or reading on a table, however, the kickstand is made of cheap plastic and doesn't seem sturdy at all. In addition, the kickstand doesn't fall flat with the rest of the case and doesn't allow the phone to lie flat. Unfortunately, the rest of the case feels cheap as well. The main body is plastic and the rubber button pushers don't even fully cover the buttons. They feel very cheap and I don't think it will last for much longer. The corners of the case also feel cheap. The corners are not rounded and are sharp and very angular. However, the absolute worst aspect of this case, even worse than the cheap feel of the case, is the fact that wireless charging, at least with Samsung's first-party wireless charger, does not work. Because of how much the kickstand juts out from the case and the thickness of the case, wireless charging does not work. Every time you go to place your Galaxy S7 Edge onto the wireless charging stand you will have to take the case off which would definitely be a deal breaker for me. While this case does will protect your phone from minor drops, the cheap build quality as well as the fact that wireless charging will not work with this case, I cannot recommend the Zizo case for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.\n\nPros:\n- Thin\n- Will protect your phone from minor drops\n- Kickstand\n\nCons:\n- Cheap feel and build quality\n- Not durable\n- Cheap kickstand\n- NO wireless charging\n\nIf you found this review helpful I would appreciate it if you clicked the \"helpful\" button below this review.

It is a well packaged, in a plastic case, kit that has everything you need for a quick and easy install. It comes with a wet cleaning wipe as well as a sticky paper for dust removal and a microfiber cloth for drying and polishing. If by chance you have other phone safe cleaning solution and microfiber lint free cloths, use them too. You can never get your iPhone too clean before applying a glass screen cover.\n\nAfter scrubbing down your phone you carefully position the shield over your phone and peel away the backing exposing the sticky side. Dont keep the shield too far from the phone and don't delay after peeling, dust is your enemy and there is dust in the air. When you place it down, after aligning the cut outs, you will see like magic, all the bubbles disappear. There are cutouts or notches for the earpiece, proximity sensor, camera and home button. Once in place you will notice that the surface is coated to dramatically reduce fingerprints and smearing. The glass is also very clear and doesnt distort anything. This shield doesnt follow the curve of the iPhone glass but that can just lead to failure anyway. For extra protection put a case on the phone that has room for the glass shield and it will stay put even better.  There will be much less tendency for the edge of the shield to catch on a pants pocket. Overall Im happy with this protective glass cover.\n\nThis product was provided at or nearly no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review.", "summary": "Great protection and proper cutouts", "unixReviewTime": 1441497600}

Its as beautiful as black iPhone 5S and Kitkat OS is on par (actually better) with iOS. You can say its bigger iPhone (I mean it) because Android OS is more flexible, customizable and powerful and it is bigger than in size like its big brother. The bigger size definitely helps in games and all kind of media consumption.\n\nThis device performance is buttery smooth and the overall experience inspires utmost satisfaction. Given its size it feels so light and slim even compared to iPhone 5/5s.\n\nIt is not even best nexus device so far but best out yet among all.\n\nAnd now I will explain it.\n--------------------------\n1. Design, look and build quality-> I differ here from most reviewers who says its plain or boring and nothing stands out of this. Its as good looking as black (space gray) iPhone 5S. Its all black like iPhone 5s. Though its made of plastic its feels sturdy, well built with precision only known to Apple. And for the people who tell iPhone made of aluminum, Nexus 5 sides appears no inferior to iPhone 5S black sides. The front glass is very well fused with the body with almost no gaps. Now what we are left with? Back? The back of Nexus 5 is though made of plastic it feels very good in the hand and due to its matte finish does not seem to slip off.\n\nNow one step further...\niPhone 5S black (or space gray) seems to have identity crisis of being black or something else, Nexus 5 black is perfectly black and it has got radically different sides (not plain round rectangle which all other smartphones have). The sides are beautifully something else.\niPhone 5S beauty is revealing and Nexus 5 beauty being black is mysterious and never gets boring.\n\nI love this black beauty and don't blame for my taste as they said \"beauty lies in the eyes of beholders\".\n\n\"Simplicity is Beauty and Beauty is simplicity, nothing more, nothing less.\" - Oscar Wilde. If any phone on the market lives up to the Oscar Wilde's quote its Nexus 5.\n\nIn short its unapologetically simple\".\n\n2. Processor/speed-> Buttery/silky smooth. Neck to neck with iPhone 5s and second only to Note 3 for all practical purposes.\n\n3. Screen/display-> Awesome. Its better than retina any time as its full HD. The feeling of display being washed up goes away very soon and remember the so called best retina have the same problem as they share the same display technology.\n\n4. Ecosystem-> Android eco system is as good as Apple's. In fact I find it better because of Android OS power you have kind of powerful applications which Apple fan boys can never have. Apple fan boys just give a try to 'tasker' (Warning: Only if you can handle Android's raw power.)\n\n5. Powerful Soul-> \"Fools are those who don't want their souls to be powerful.\" Its as good as iOS but better why? because its powerful and customizable. You can do the things with it when you need. Its no way comparable to inferior iOS. Apple fan boys! People should not be proud of a system which does not even let them change default for anything.\n\n6. Call Quality -> Fantastic. I have never had so clear voice on call for very long.\n\n7. Network Signal Quality -> Fantastic.\n\n8. Volume/Speaker-> Inherently the speaker is very loud. Though in some application it might sound a little short of enough but its software related problem and should be fixed in future update. I have tested the volume in many application like play and in some apps are freaking load. While playing music through play I had to cut down on the volume in car its so powerful.\n\nWith headphones its fantastic. The voice quality is very superior and has no noise in it. Its as pure as it gets.\n\n9. Camera-> I have seen all the comparisons of Nexus 5 with all leading phones (HTC one, Nokia Lumia, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4) and its competing neck to neck in every department except its little slow to focus. But once it focus it takes very good images. HDR+ beats all other phones (I swear it). But again Google admitted it was software related issue and would be fixed soon through update. Personally I am pretty satisfied with the camera.\n\nIts at least best nexus phone camera and comparable to others except in little slower to focus. The photos are very detailed with accurate colors.\n\nNote: I have uploaded some photos for reference.\n\n10. Battery-> No complaints. Nothing great or bad here. Its definitely better than many old phones (including galaxy nexus) and equal to many others.\n\nIt just falls short of only two smart phones right now which are LG G2 and Note 3. But it's battery is comparable to the best smartphone i.e. iPhone 5s. So if iPhone 5S can be the best with that kind of battery I don't understand how we could complain of Nexus 5. For casual usage you will charging it once a day. The noticeable thing is that in idle mode it does not eat battery at all and that's where it will average out better end of the day.\n\n11. Reparability-> iFixit has given its 8 of 10 in this department and you should feel comfortable saving your money on costly repair by doing many things yourself and the whole assembly is modular.\n\nSummary-> Even keeping its lower price aside, Its the one of best smart phone and should equal or better any best smart phone on the planet right now. And you add advantage of lower price...", "summary": "Its big brother of iPhone (5s) literally, best nexus phone and best smart phone period", "unixReviewTime": 1384473600}

The product is actually great. I've used Invisible Shield and hated the orange peel effect and I've also used Body Guardz. Neither came close to the quality this screen protector provides. I'd definitely recommend to anyone else.\n\nA couple of notes for people who may need assurance on installation...\nMake sure to really wet your fingers and the front and back of the screen protector. I've also sprayed some solution on my screen. I laid the screen protector on the screen until it was gliding above the screen. Afterwards, I brushed out gently with the squeegee and cloth until air bubbles were gone. There were no air bubbles left actually. Once it was applied, (although they recommended not to turn on your device after installation, I did so anyhow) the screen looked pixelated. Although, I did this right before I slept so I woke up the next morning and the pixelation faded away maybe about 3/4. Within the next day, The screen was almost crystal clear. A week later my screen is crystal! I will post pictures.\n\nOne take away though is that I do feel the sensitivity of the screen is less responsive. Not so much, but enough to notice a tad difference.\n\n-------Edit 8/18\n\nOkay so sensitivity issue is completely gone. It's as good as bare screen. The only thing that's bugging me right now is these two dents on the screen that won't heal...creating air bubbles or artifacting underneath. In that area its terrible response. I know I can take it off, clean it, and reapply but that's too much hassle and its tolerable. Just to note, after washing your hands, using the screen is near unbearable (But that goes to about any screen protector) in that your fingers don't slide almost at all and you kind of require some finger sweat or oil to make it smooth again. Overall, this product is great. Recommended it to many friends and bought them and they seem to be satisfied.\n\n-------Edit 10/16\n\nThe screen protector is starting to peel off and scratches are developing. It's quite unsightly.

One thing I really like about this screen protector and I've used many is how little fingerprints and smudges shows up on it. The ones that do are much less smudgy than others that I've used and they are very easily wiped away. This protector cleans so easy that I can't believe the difference it is from my last screen protector, also glass. It's always looking crystal clear and there is no glare or rainbow effect from this tempered glass which is a great plus.\n\nThe tempered glass is a little bit thinner than others but you still get that protection you want from scratches and marks on your devices original screen. This is maximum hardness so not to worry needing it to be so thick and it feels a little nicer to the touch. There is also another point I would like to mention and that is that this tempered glass is very smooth. I use the S pen a lot and it is very nice to write something and I would say even nicer that writing on the bare screen and the touch sensitivity is equal to the screen itself. My scrolling is the smoothest I've felt both with S pen and just my finger and this glass protector is my choice now that I've tried it for myself.\n\nI have used many protectors and most of the big named brands and in my opinion this protector is right at the top of my list. I would highly recommend you to give it a try for yourself it's worth it and the price is very reasonable. Nice tempered glass screen protector I'm very impressed by it.

Owl's version of the Cardboard VR was a great way to try out the experience.  Assembly was really easy.  Just flip the cardboard flaps out and connect everything together where you see the velcro tabs.  I have a larger phone (LG Optimus Pro G) and while my phone did not fit with the case on, it did fit perfectly without the case.  There was an elastic band that is meant to hold this to your head for hands free VR.  Just secure the velcro tabs roughly eye level and you are good to go.  Also, the button for interacting with the screen worked perfectly with my phone.\n\nAfter using the unit several times, there are a couple areas that I feel could be improved.\n1)  The nose piece is pretty rough and can begin to hurt after a few minutes.  A simple silicone nose piece could resolve that discomfort.\n2)  While its hard to design a one size fits all device for phones and cases, I would have liked to see a little more room where you insert your phone.  Any dead space could be filled in with foam spacers for a customized fit for more phones and allowing some use with slim cases.\n\nThe Google Cardboard apps requests that you scan a bar code on the viewer to get started.  It recognized this Owl viewer right away and the experience worked great.  I recommend that you have a higher end phone as there was a little lag when I used it which made me dizzy since you are so close to the action.  Thats no fault of the Owl viewer, but just a tip for anyone new to Google Cardboard.  You can even download the app and try it before ordering to see if your phone can handle it.  You will just see your screen in a \"fisheye split view\" but can see if it lags.\n\nOverall this is a great way to test out the Google VR experience.  I received this kit gratis for my honest review.", "summary": "Great way to test out the Google VR experience", "unixReviewTime": 1452988800}

The flap has interior pockets that can hold 2 credit cards/IDs and some cash. The chocolate color is nice and the case looks nice - not like some cheap leather ones that look very plasticky. The inside hard case is black and does hold the iPhone without covering up the edges like a slimfit case that I really like.\n\nI thought it was a perfect case for the times I did not want to take the whole purse, like on a walk, for outdoor activities or to a club at night. However, I very soon realized that after you put the phone in it, it's hard to talk on it unless you flip out the top flap and hold it to the back of the phone. That makes it awkward, plus if you have cash or IDs in it you would not like to flip out the whole thing and have it fall out. Repeated folding back of the top flap is also creasing the leather and it will look unattractive, so I'd rather not do that. So if I don't flip the top flap back the phone is fine for browsing or texting but it's really awkward to make calls on it unless I use a bluetooth or a headphone. I am not sure I want to do that.\n\nOne other limiting factor for me is that since I saw this case as a special occasion case for outdoors or for clubs I have to pop out my iPhone from it's regular case and put it in this case. This case holds the iPhone really tight, which is great but doesn't really make it easy to switch it back and forth. So despite the good looks the design does not work for my usage and it will not be getting much use.\n\nI received a free sample for review like the 3 other reviewers.

I think one word is really enough for a review of this case.\n\nI tend to favor less rather than more when it comes to cases in order to not feel like I'm carrying a brick in my pocket.  Most of the armor cases are simply out of the question due to their weight.  That still typically left me with plenty of choices but given the curved edges of the S6 Edge, I thought it might be hard to find a case to my satisfaction.  Prior to this, I got the Enther Clear case and Spigen Slim case.  With Enther, I found the buttons hard to press and the protection not nearly enough to absorb any sort of a drop considering how thin it is around the edges.  With the Spigen, I had a case with the same material before few years ago and I know the plastic may not substain a drop.  I also looked at the Spigen Neo Hybrid but decided against it due to it only available in dark colors.  I got a white phone and I wanted some bright colors!!\n\nAfter looking around, I finally landed on this Caseology Wavelength case for the Edge.  All around, it is a very solid case that is well made beyond the $16 that I spent on it.  The bumpers on all four sides are just thick enough that I feel comfortable that they will protect the phone.  It feels like Caseology properly tested the case and got the right feel to it without sacrificing the look.  Especially with the rubber back, it feels grippy and is good looking at the same time.  The buttons have a solid feel and I definitely didn't feel like I have to make too much effort pushing them unlike the Enther case.  At the same time, I don't accidentally press the buttons by accidents either because the pressure really feel just right.  Also, the case looked and felt like it totally wrapped around the phone that the phone won't pop out on a drop and it is not difficult to remove just in case you want to change it out.\n\nThe only minor regret is with the cutout for the camera and flash.  It is one big cutout like majority of other cases, though I understand it does make things easier for them to have it that way, it seems that having specific cutout for both the camera and the flash separately would make it look even better.\n\nPro:\nIt feels nice in hand\nIt is well constructed\nIt looks like it'll protect the phone well while not taking away from the look\nIt is thin and grippy\nButtons feel just right\nColor is vibrant and design hit the right notes in the right area\n\nMinor Con:\nSingle cutout for both camera and flash", "summary": "Best case for the S6 edge hands down", "unixReviewTime": 1436140800}

The size also makes it really nice to be able to have it charging a device and leave them connected in pocket without a bunch of bulk.\n\nHaving the laser pointer and flash light built in is really nice. It makes the IMP52D the perfect extra device to carry around in briefcase since it can also be used in a meeting for a pointer (plus it looks nice so it won't be out of place at a business meeting or lunch). It took me a litte bit to figure out how to use the single button to true on/off the laser, flashlight and charger. But once I got it figured out, it was easy to use.

Usually when a phone is dropped on the corner all of the impact goes straight into the screen, usually shattering it.  This case is designed in a way that takes that shock and distributes it into the outer edges of the case instead, protecting your screen.  I haven't really seen this design in any other cases and I think it's really smart.\n\nThis case came with a screen protector, which I think it nice.  It's the typical thin plastic kind, but if you don't have one yet it could save your screen.\n\nThis case has two parts- the inner Polycarbonate flexible layer and an outer thick rigid plastic layer for extra protection.  This outer layer has a slot where you can stand it up using a credit card (or a gift card! Don't use a credit card in public or you're setting yourself up for identity theft.)  This feature is nice if you want to watch a video.  The two layers will come apart if you want to remove the outer layer for any reason.\n\nThis case wraps around in front of the screen, protecting it from a face down drop, but does not have front coverage (except for the free screen protector)\n\nThe only thing I dislike about this case is that the buttons are hard to push.  I press the side buttons on my phone a lot and I've noticed it takes significantly more effort with this case.  Maybe it's just me being lazy, but I like button pressing to be easy.  On the plus side, this probably means the buttons are well protected.  All other ports are open and easy to access, but don't have any protection, so it's a trade off.\n\nOverall, This is a pretty nice case for the cost.  I received this item at no charge in return for my honest review, which I have provided here.

Well this is the one for you to get. The only thing about this charger is it has a red light that shines to show its getting power. Which would be annoying if you only use it at night to charge your phone and tablet. But for you guys that have an iPhone 5 or higher then you get a free awesome looking lighting cable to charge you device. But I will get to it later in the review because theirs and issue with it.\n\nBut back to the charger. The charge has a nice gloss finish that make the charge nice and shine and has 2x 2.4 Amp Smart USB ports. So all you devices will charge faster and be safe from over charge or over heating issues.  This charger works so great I actually replaced my original Apple one. The charger will get hot if you are charging 2 devices at the same time.\n\nNow to the cable they include. The cable is not a MFI Certified Lighting Cable, but the cable has a slight issue when using it to charge the iPad. For some reason when using this cable to charge your iPad it will take forever for it to be completely charge. It takes a good 6 hours to charge from 10% to 100% Vs only 3 hours with most other cables. Also when testing the cable I notice that when it charges an iPhone It will pop up the message that states This Accessory may not be supported when the Phone is done charging. But the cable look awesome because of the cable is fiber optic laced which makes the cable stand out.\n\nSo I would defiantly recommend the charger to people but not the cable that is included because it seems like there is something wrong with the cable that is included. So IXCC might want to take a look at it and see why it won't work correctly but the charger itself is still worth buying even if the cable doesn't work right.\n\n\"I was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation", "summary": "Great Charger but Not So Great Cable", "unixReviewTime": 1429056000}

However I hate iTunes so I wanted to look into an Android phone.\nThe Samsung Infuse has a beautiful screen, it's slim and light, and navigation seemed easy enough. I like the Android interface, customizations, widgets, and the beautiful live wallpaper. Apps opened very quickly and ran well.\nThe sound quality on my Samsung Infuse was not as clear and good as my iPhone 3G. I had a few people complain that they had difficulty hearing me. One of those times I was on a Bluetooth headset, and I never had a single complaint about sound quality with my headset on my iPhone, but on this phone my husband couldn't hear me well with the bluetooth headset enabled.\nThe signal strength was not as good as my iPhone 3G. I lost my signal in areas where I was able to make calls from my iPhone. I was disappointed because I do live in a rural area with lots of weak signal areas, and I need a phone that works in those areas!  The iPhone always did well for me, even in weak signal areas.\nAnother problem for me was the phone was a little too wide for my hands. With the iphone, I had it in a case and the case fit well against the palm of my hand. This phone, being so thin and flat, I could only grip it by the beveled edge. My palm had no contact with the phone. It slipped out of my hand so many times! The phone feels so fragile because it's thin. That said, it fit really well in my pocket (without a case). I was afraid of breaking it all the time though.\nI am left-handed, and that's never really been a problem before in using a phone, however with the Samsung Infuse, maybe because the screen is so wide, I found it was really awkward to hold and control with my left hand. The volume rocker on the left and the power button on the right are positioned in such a way I was getting them constantly and annoyingly confused.\nAnother issue that may just affect left-handers, according to what I read on the internet (may not be true, I can't confirm) when you answer the phone with your right hand, something inside the phone (accelerometer maybe?) senses the movement and understands you are answering the phone, and it locks the touch screen so you don't accidentally touch the \"end call\" button. It didn't screen-lock when I answered so I ended up accidentally hanging up on people.\nThe phone has a front-facing camera but as of this writing, it doesn't support Skype video chat.\nThe screen is beautiful, however there is no Netflix app like there is for the iPhone, and no Hulu plus app, although there are some other android phones that can get Hulu plus.\nThe music player wasn't very easy to use or very handy, the battery life was poor for me - it could not hold a charge through a full day, on my unit, the headphone jack didn't work. All of these things combined to make it the wrong choice of phone for me.", "summary": "Too New, Not Intuitive Enough For Me", "unixReviewTime": 1309996800}

Not much else to say about something like this. I got the device because I found myself with a lot of stuff to charge beside me at night.\n\nI use this charger with non-data enabled USB cables. In fact, it's the only reason I got this vs. a Qualcomm Quick Charge (QC) 2.0 or 3.0 bank. You're not supposed to use non-data enabled USB cables with those devices (I don't know the reason). So to be safe, I got this for all of my non-QC enabled devices so I don't have to use the ports on my other bank that I got that IS QC enabled on all ports.\n\nAs I mentioned, it charges all of my devices well. The block itself is rather compact and feels very solid. I got one in each color, black and white. There's a little light to indicate that the device is plugged in. You also get a nice long power cable.\n\n+4 stars because it's clean, good power. Measured, I do get up to ~2.3A per port when using all ports and my non-data enabled usb cables. I get just a bit less than that with data enabled usb cables.\n\n-1 star because I may actually have to move it out of my bedroom due to noise. The device makes a hissy/whiney noise and even though I like sound while sleeping (music, TV, etc), whenever the room becomes quiet the noise this makes stands out big time. Suffice it to say, it's very annoying if you're sitting there reading your tablet or phone in a quiet room. My wife also hears it and she sleeps on the opposite side. It doesn't wake us up, it's not loud noise, it's just consistent noise. If it annoys me, it will annoy anyone imho, especially those requiring a quiet bedroom.\n\nIn the end, it's not a deal breaker for me. I'll likely move it to the living room or some other area so I can quickly pop a device or 6 to charge. I have my eye on another device, which I also own that is completely quiet. I may just spring to get another one, it's a few dollars more than this but worth it.", "summary": "Works, but has a noise problem.", "unixReviewTime": 1459641600}

They have an inner silicone layer and a hard plastic outer shell, a lot like an OtterBox Commuter case.  But unlike the OtterBox, the Speck is one piece.  You won't spend time massaging silicone around to get a good fit.  The solid of-a-piece construction and the fairly large raised edge around the perimeter of the glass screen gives you a lot of confidence that your phone will survive if you drop it on the sidewalk.\n\nThe Candy Shell case fits the iPhone 5S just fine.  The Lightning port opening is large enough to fit third party cables, including the Amazon Basic Lightning cable.\n\nCandy Shell cases are very hansom in my opinion.  The glossy black plastic married to the dark gray silicone makes a good looking combination.  But the hansom glossy plastic shell is also the worst feature of this case.\n\nThe glossy surface scratches ridiculously easily.  I installed my phone and laid it on its back on my wood desk.  That's all it took to put scuffs and scratches all over the back of the case.  The glossy plastic also attracts dust.  A lot of it.  You'll be amazed how much lint is in your pocket.

I LOVE this case. I love things that are multi use and this case fits the bill. I had bought a similar case previous to this, but this one is so much better. The case itself is a black, smooth leathery material. There is a chrome accent strip on the outside, and I LOVE chrome of any kind. The threading on the inside is red, which is not only cool, but in a rush you can tell which side you are on by the color. The outside thread is black. The inside pockets are a little cheap. I fear they won't last too long with multiple uses. The pockets are cut in a way that makes it easy to put in and take a card out, but they are not reinforced so they are brittle. Behind the card holders is a large hidden pocket, more storage is always a plus. Now the best part, the phone case that attaches to the phone itself, is a separate piece!! So this piece is has the same smooth black leather like material covering the back, which makes it match the folding case. The inside where the phone goes in, is a smooth matte plastic which prevents the phone from scratching. That piece stays on the phone and attaches to the folding case by way of magnet. The magnet is very strong, the phone attaches easily with minimal effort, and it goes on straight, automatically. Super cool. Previous phone cases like this did not have this magnet feature. It was difficult to take pictures or put the phone to your ear when talking on the phone. But now you can remove the phone for these purposes.

Not that I really interchange them all that much, actually never, but it's really nice knowing that I can if I ever want to. Not that I will. Either way, I will definitely buy again and recommend to friends and family (the family not noted above as being loved less than my kick ass car).\n\nOh, by the way, there's nothing but brutal honesty posted in this review.

In fact, I like it so much I'm ordering another one, in a different color, just because. Best. Case. Ever.\n\nI am pleasantly surprised by the Q Case for my iPhone 6+. The build quality is excellent. It's unbelievably thin, considering it can easily hold three of my credit cards and a couple of folded $20 bills. Also, it's really good looking. I bought the gold colored case. Very stylish. Feels great in the hand. Not too slippery, but also won't stick in your pocket so you have to fumble for it.\n\nThe front of the case wraps over the front of the phone, giving the screen protection so that you can lay the phone down on its face. The buttons work perfectly over top of the iPhone's buttons. Really easy to feel them, but also not obtrusive. Someone really put a lot of thought into this case.\n\nI had thought that I'd only be using this case for travel, but the truth is I've never taken it off the phone because I like that much more than my other cases (Apple silicone and leather cases).\n\nIt will also allow for the use of any screen protector, including the relatively thick Zagg Glass Protectors.\n\nAbsolutely recommend this case, especially because it won't break your bank either.", "summary": "Best Case I've Found For My iPhone 6+", "unixReviewTime": 1427155200}

This was an Amazon-Twelve South purchase, not from a third party vendor.\n\nAs other reviewers have stated you must use the smaller 1 millimeter Apple cable. My iPhone 6 plus was shipped with the 2 millimeter cable so I used the cable I was using for my iPod Touch. The unit assembles pretty easily. I tested the dock plugs with my case on my phone before inserting into the post. I use the Speigen Tough Armor Case and the number 2 plug fits perfectly. The case is stable enough. I do use my second hand to hold the base when removing the phone. I have had to do that with other docks too. Under normal circumstances the phone is secure on the dock. Small children with prying fingers could topple it.\n\nI would like to mention to Twelve South that if they used a magnetized Allen wrench it would make inserting those four screws much easier. I mean this is a premium dock so it would be nice to have a premium experience assembling it. I also had to work with it to keep the wire cover snap out piece on the underside bottom of the base from coming loose even though the cable was firmly seated in the grooves. I removed the little cellophane type \"pull\" piece and then is snapped and stayed in place.\n\nOver all I am very pleased with the premium look and the functionality of this dock. My back support works perfectly and fully supports the back of the phone. And the absolute best thing I like about this dock is it should work with future iPhones. The design is ingenious. The one thing I hate is spending a lot of money for an iPhone accessory only to have it rendered useless when Apple redesigns their phone. This dock is so adjustable that I believe that problem will be eliminated with future phones unless Apple has a very radical design change such as curving the phones.  And the fact that this dock will work with a large variety of cases out there is the biggest plus of all.\n\nI decided to take a picture of the dock. Some previous reviews have stated that the back post is cut incorrectly rendering the back support useless. They obviously did not receive an actual \"Twelve South\" dock. As you can see my back support aligns perfectly. Again, I ordered this through Amazon Prime - Twelve South, not a third party vendor. I feel you are pretty safe by ordering the dock this way. And if something is wrong it is much easier returning to Amazon vs. a vendor.", "summary": "Just received this dock and I really like it.

In order to power the light, you just need to plug in the cord on the side of the stick to the port next to the light. The light has three brightness settings and can be rotated to suit your preferences. The handle has an ergonomic design and grooves for your fingers which makes it easy to maneuver as needed. The fit is a bit snug with my iPhone 6 but still manageable.\n\nPros:\n Luxury Selfie Stick\n Bluetooth Shutter\n Rear Mirror\n LED Light\n Works with Most Smart Phones\n Beautiful Design and Colors\n Front & Rear Selfie Capabilities\n Long Battery Life\n\nThis particular selfie stick extends to approximately 2 feet.

These days, we have the radio, bluetooth, and aux plugs to listen to our favorite songs. This is where Koomus comes in. Koomus is a company who makes many different mounts for smartphones and tablets. They have an awesome little mount called the Pro CD Slot Car Mount. This mount allows you to mount your phone, or small tablet in the CD slot of your car. The first thing I noticed when I took the mount out of the packaging was its weight. Its super lightweight. The body is plastic, the grips are rubber, and the extendable clamp is made of metal. The metal clamp is what grips your phone and holds it securely in place. I was actually a bit surprised with how good of quality the clamp is. It can accommodate any phone or tablet as long as it is within 3.4 inches wide. I clamped in my iPhone 6s Plus with a case, and it had no problem holding it up. To insert the mount, you must push the top button, and insert it into the CD slot of your car. The mount itself has rubber on both sides which is how it secures itself in the CD slot. Surprisingly, it gets a very sturdy grip. I tested this mount on 3 different cars, and it fit in every one. There was one car that it had a very tight fit, and required a little extra force to fully insert. An awesome feature of this mount is its 360 degree rotating capabilities. You can rotate your phone at any angle thats comfortable for you or your passenger. One thing I wish this mount had was a higher quality ball. The ball is the part that the mount rotates around. The plastic ball works fine, but I think the rotation could be even smoother if a higher quality material was used such as metal. I think the Koomus Pro CD Slot is a great car accessory to have. Its super convenient considering not too many people use their CD slots anymore. And if you happened to need access to your CD slot, the big button on the top makes it easy to remove. Overall, the construction of this mount gets an 8/10. The plastic body is sturdy and does what was intended, but I would have loved to see more metal on a device like this. Honestly, for $25.00, its not going to get much better than this. In conclusion, If you need a sturdy mount that will hold your device at a comfortable angle and won't fall down, this is the one.", "summary": "Perfect Mount!", "unixReviewTime": 1455148800}

Coming from a Samsung Focus which I was quite happy with, it was nice that the cable and chargers are compatible. I was bummed that there wasn't a microSD expansion slot but managed to make it work with the zune wireless sync features. Also, it was unclear from the terrible AT&T and Samsung spec pages but there is indeed the FM radio feature (as part of the zune app).\n\nI'm really amazed how thin the Focus S is and didn't initially plan to get a case but decided to afterwards since there is very little purchase for your fingers to wrap around. The extra screen real estate is great for news apps although I was a bit surprised that the tint turns a bit blue-ish when viewing angle turns extreme. Not a day to day issue at all. Also, it's nice that the camera is centered rather than at one of the edges as it's easier to get used to the angle.\n\nThe original Focus having the micro-USB was nice as it was easier to keep charged and using the device unlike the Focus S which is at the bottom (also like the iPhones).\n\nThe one buggy feature is that the ambient light sensor doesn't seem to control the display brightness very well - had to turn the feature off.\n\nFInally, the snap on case on the back is interesting as it doesn't cover the entire back of the device. Not many reasons to do a soft reset anyway with the stability of Mango.", "summary": "it's too thin!", "unixReviewTime": 1321056000}

Hmmm\n\nZTE now says the upgrade to Nougat is a matter of weeks. And oh yeah... the fingerprint scanner is awesome.

Either throw away or return it.\n2 stars (I don't like it): Don't like it and wouldn't use it again, but may still have at least 1 positive thing about it.\n3 stars (Its ok): Product has both positives and negatives, and I may or may not continue using it. Someone else may like it more and is potentially still worth purchasing.\n4 stars (I like it): Item as described in functionality purpose and quality. May have 1 or 2 things I don't care for or would change, but not big issues. Would recommend if asked, but wouldn't say I love it.\n5 stars (I love it!): Practically perfect. Nothing lacking in functionality or quality. I Love it and would not only recommend, but would purchase for others and continue to purchase for myself.\n\nMY THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT:\n  This case is pretty functional, I carry 2 wallets one for my cards (credit/Health Ins/discount cards) the other for ID (license/work ID/ECT). I have been looking for a way to slim down to the necessities on off days or just hanging out. This is perfect! I can just slide my license and one credit card in the compartment. But that's it! you can not fit anything like currency in there. I attempted to use this all weekend long and it served its purpose. I actually felt liberated I didn't have to carry the heavy wallets around. I received another case from caseguru and the issues I had with that one seemed to have been resolved on this version. The headphone jack is easy to access and the raised rubber buttons are easy to use. Lightening plugs in fine with no interference. The toggle switch is a little difficult to get to for silent mode but not a big deal. Overall it;s a nice case, the color is nice and I think it will hold up for a while. The case is made from a combination of plastic and rubber. The plastic feels cheep with the right hit it will break but you can say that about anything. I am pretty gentle with my devices so I believe this will last a while for me.\n\nPROS:\n1. Easy to apply\n2. great for days out where you don't want to take much\n3. Astatically pleasing (it looks good)\n\nCONS:\n1.  Toggle switch for silent is difficult to switch.\n\nTime will tell on the durability of this product, if this product fails or if there are any issues during my use I will update the review in a follow up and adjust my rating accordingly.\n\nSHOULD YOU BUY IT?  Yes\n\nFOLLOWUP: N/A", "summary": "Quick and Easy for those days you want to travel light.", "unixReviewTime": 1466380800}

So when I saw this power inverter all kinds of possibilities ran through my head and I jumped at the chance to try it.\n\nIt arrived in a small box with just the device and a single letter sized sheet pamphlet of instructions. The instructions are brief with about 75% of them being safety warnings and precautions.\n\nBefore using it, I quickly inspected the power inverter. It is designed to conveniently fit in a cupholder and is pretty much the shape of the bottom half of a curved taper tall coffee mug with a 2.5 x 2 inch elliptical vent on each side. It has a fairly sturdy in construction with a fairly hefty 15  20amp cable to 12vDV cigarette lighter plug.\n\nSince this is conveniently designed to sit in a cup holder, all the functions are on the top surface which includes a piggyback 12v lighter/accessory socket, a single standard three-prong grounded AC outlet and dual USB 5v charging ports.\n\nIn Use\n\nOne of the reasons I liked the idea of one of these is that we only have a single vehicle and live in a flood risk area. So I thought this might be a useful tool in an emergency. So I plan on mostly keeping it in the car because it could come in quite handy one day by providing us with much-needed power. I also got it for convenience when camping, charging notebooks on the move or powering an LED work-light or charging RC car batteries with an AC battery charger and powering a fairly loud solid state electric guitar amp.\n\nUsing it is pretty straightforward. I was a little concerned because my only car is a Mazda MX-5 which, by todays standards, has a small standard battery.\n\nDespite my initial hesitation, when I plugged the accessory/cigarette lighter plug into the cars 12v power socket I was very pleased with how solid the connection was. The springs on the side are very strong and made a very good snug connection. In my car there is no power supplied till you insert the key and at least turn it to the first accessory stage. When the inverter receives power, a row of LEDs light up to indicate the level of your cars battery. The first one is red indicating low battery. The other three are green.\n\nI really wanted to test the guitar idea because it is something fun Id like to take camping. I have a 10w sound output pam that draws 40w of electrical power. Initially plugging this in on accessory produced 1 red and 2 green power indicator lights. If I turned on the engine then I got all three green lights. The amplifier powers up just fine and worked a treat. I can turn the volume up more than loud enough.  When I turned the engine back off to accessory, the power indicator light still shows all three green LEDs. Work light, dremel tool and powering the notebook all work fine too.\n\nI didn't want to push it with anything like power tools with a large current draw. My car lighter socket has a 15amp fuse.\n\nI found that the power inverter has a fuse inside the plug. You access the fuse by unscrewing the knurled fastner just above the sprung tip. The fuse is rated at 20 amps and 32 volts. So in some cars like mine there is the potential to blow the cigarette lighter fuse before the Sungoldpower inverter fuse blows. 20 amps is quite a lot. It might be worth checking your vehicle and getting a lower spec fuse if you're thinking of using devices that use a heavy load.\n\nThe AC outlet socket has a very snug connection so it required quite a bit of strength to pull the three prong AC plug out again. This isn't a bad thing at all.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a very handy device that will provide a decent AC power source similar to your wall outlets at home. I played my guitar for a good half hour no problem after using it. I haven't used it for much else but am very happy. If you're going to power something for a long period you will probably want the engine running so the car battery keeps charging. I have a really small car that doesnt have any convenient cup holders since there are only two inside the center console and you cant change gear with the manual stick-shift when they are being used. But my car is the exception. Most American cars have an abundance of cup-holders..\n\nEven so, Im giving this a 5 stars. I really like it, it does a good job, seems well made, is dependable and offers a lot of possibilities, especially if you like road trips and camping or travel a lot because of work.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this inverter in exchange for an honest and fair review.  The opinions expressed are my own.", "summary": "Convenient and dependable", "unixReviewTime": 1456704000}

I have the Note 4 with a very slim case on it.  Feels like if I had a more substantial case, this mount would not be able to open wide enough for it to fit.

Granted, the Note 4 is big and heavy but the mount shakes quite a bit when I'm driving over rough pavement. It was a little distracting at first but since it has fallen yet I'm not too worried about it. For the price (I paid around $10) this mount cannot be beat.  I recommend it.\n\nEdit a month later - After a few more weeks of use the mount broke when I was trying to put my phone in it.  The body separated from the suction cup rendering this mount useless.

With the belt clip this is quite the beast.  So if you are looking for a svelte, unassuming case read no further, this isn't made for you.  However, if you are looking for a dual layer protective case that has the added benefit of providing an additional 160% battery life then this may suit your needs.\n\nPros:\n-  First and foremost is the additional battery life provided.  The 4600 mAh battery will extend life approximately 160% over stock.  Your mileage may vary, as I tend to use my phone while charging.  You may get more life if you aren't as heavy a user.\n- The battery itself is removable and can be changed out rather easily with another.\n- Overall the case provides good protection.  The inner hard plastic shell is a cinch to install and remove.  The iPhone 6 slides into the bottom half and mates with the lightning connector, then the front/side portion of the plastic case is snapped into place.  Finally the outer soft shell is slipped over and locks into a ridge running along the entire front of the plastic case.  Removal is just as easy reversing the previous process.\n- As noted earlier the battery is removable, it sits in a compartment built into the back of the plastic hard case.  Its held in place by the soft shell.\n- The face of the phone is left open, a screen protector is provided with the case.  I prefer this to the ones with a plastic covering over the screen and the home button.  Theres no interference with touch ID and the screen sensitivity is not affected.\n- The forward facing speaker holes do a good job in redirecting the audio towards you when watching the screen.\n- The volume and power button covers are well done and very responsive.\n- The charging and earphone ports are well covered and sits in place nicely\n- The charging button is located on the front and is easily accessible, as is the battery charge indicator.\n- The belt clip is well made with multiple adjustments to carry the phone vertical, horizontal and numerous angles in between.  The case has depressions built into the sides which the clip locks into.  It should hold well under normal conditions.\n\nIssues:  There were a couple of items that detracted from the overall functionality of the case.\n-  The cover for the mute switch was loose and did not close well.  Theres a small tab that locks into a small hole in the side of the plastic case.  Unfortunately with the size of the cover the tab doesnt do a very good job of holding it in place.  The cover usually popped open with minimal disturbance, allowing dust/dirt to enter.\n- My biggest pet peeve was the earphone adapter.  If used with the original iPhone buds everything worked well.  The connector of the Apple buds fit perfectly into the earphone adapter and was easily plugged into the phone.  The problem comes in with 3rd party earphones/buds, depending on how the connector is styled you may or may not be able to use the earphone adapter (more than likely not).  If not youll have to use the supplied metallic earphone jack.  Heres where the problem lies, the supplied jack doesnt fit into the earphone adapter at all. This means you have the adapter laying around outside of the case and not attached in anyway, making it easy to lose/misplace.  And if you lose the plastic earphone adapter the front facing speaker holes don't work very well as the majority of the sound escapes out of the unblocked earphone jack port.  My felling is that the supplied metallic jack should at least fit with the supplied plastic earphone adapter.  If you rarely or never use earphones/earbuds this probably won't bother you at all.\n\nFinal thoughts:  I feel this case fills a niche market nicely.  If you require a good protective case with dual layer shock protection and you're away from charging facilities for more than a day or two at a time this case will fill your needs very well.  The earphone jack issue is a big problem if you use 3rd party earbuds/earphones and are one to insert/remove them numerous times throughout the day.  With the metallic adapter theres just too much opportunity to lose/misplace the plastic earphone adapter.\nThe additional battery capacity is really nice.  I was able to go 2 days without connecting my phone to a charger.\nI rate this case a 3.5 - 4 out of 5 stars.  If the earphone adapter issue could be corrected such that the supplied metallic earphone jack fits into the adapter this phone, I would give it a solid 4 star rating.\n\nDisclaimer - I was provided this case without charge as a sample to review. My review is based solely on my personal use of the item. Other than the case, there was no additional compensation by ZeroLemon for my review or my opinion.", "summary": "Solid contendor for a dual layer battery case", "unixReviewTime": 1422403200}

It was one of the reasons I bought a Note 4 when they came out. I am not a VR fan boy, and have never used an Oculus VR system of any type. After installing a phone update from Verizon, and an application from Oculus (there are easy to follow directions with the system), I was ready to go.\n\nThe phone slides in pretty easy but the downside is that I have to remove my S-Flip cover and use the original back. The phone won't fit properly with the flip cover installed.\n\nMy initial impression was non-dramatic as you are presented with a few screens of safety information to agree to. I then got busy installing some experiences and games from the Oculus Store (done from the phone either within the Gear VR or using the phone normally).\n\nI was then absolutely blown away by my experiences, and while I won't go through all the games and experiences available as of this review (not too many yet but more released every week), I do want to cover some of the best that I would highly suggest you check it out right away.\n\n1. Cirque de Soleil's Zarkana - this experience was my first and although it is not the best or the longest, it immediately shows you what a 360 degree world looks like. You can not only experience the show from the stage, but you can turn around and see other stage actors and the large theater that was empty at the time it was recorded.\n\n2. Strangers with Patrick Watson - I had never heard of Patrick Watson before, so if you like his music then you will really loved this one. It puts you into his studio apartment (I assume) while he practices a bit on the piano and sings a little. The audio really does sound like you are right there with him in his home. Be sure and look to his left to see his dog - a nice touch I thought.\n\n3. Anshar Wars - this was the 2nd game I tried out, and the best so far in my opinion. You are flying a spaceship and fighting an alien enemy. I played for about an hour the first time and the whole VR experience never bothered me, but I would suggest people who get easily car sick to take it really easy.  It works without a controller, but I would suggest getting a controller anyway because it improves the experience and some games require it.\n\n4. Ocean Rift - take a dive and experience some ocean creatures up close and personal. I found this pretty cool although not something I would view often.\n\n5. Titans of Space - This is not a game so much as a tour of the Solar System. It does a really good job of giving you an idea of size of the planets and moons in our solar system. The graphics are not totally awesome, but the experience is neat.\n\n6. Oculus 360 Videos - this application has quite a few videos that are really cool to watch. One of my favorite is called 360 Iceland and is a tour of Iceland. If you get motion sickness, you might want to make sure you are sitting down the first time and be ready to take off the Gear VR if it bothers you. Samsung 360 tours takes you to New York City for another tour - also very enjoyable.\n\n7. Oculus 360 Photos - the sd card comes preloaded with a lot of 360 degree photos. It includes dozens of places and has something for everyone from nature to world renowned landmarks to abandoned places like Chernobyl. Lots to choose from here.\n\n8. Oculus Cinema - I think this will be the most used application on the Gear VR. It comes preloaded with some movie trailers both 3d and 2d, and you have a choice of 4 cinemas to watch movies in - a home theater, a standard movie theater, a theater on the surface of the moon - and a blank theater where all you see is the screen.\n\nYou have the option of copying your own movies -both 3d and 2d to the SD card of your phone to use with Oculus Cinema. You might want to check out the Oculus Gear VR forum for help in that area. As of the time of this review, there really isn't a \"store\" yet to buy content such as games and movies, but I am sure that will be available soon and will make the Oculus Cinema a true entertainment system that lets you go to the movies anytime you want and get a true cinema experience.\n\nSuggested Accessories:\n\n1.

Fits nice, looks good. I dropped my friends phone to make sure it will last. it handles really well, the installation is easy. why not buy the case. i got it a discount price. i love how nice it is, such a great gift\n\nthe review helps you, but the article aids you\n\nYou might think that cases are only for the anal retentive that care about keeping their phone pristine, but there's more to it than that. Things you want to think about include:\n\nDrop Protection: Look, no matter how careful you are, gravity is just stronger than you. You'll probably drop your phone at least once or twice in the years that you own it. How much protection you need, though, depends on your phone: lots of Android phones are built a bit tougher, and are more likely to survive the occasional drop (I'm speaking from lots of experience here). The iPhone 4 or 4S, on the other hand, while blessed with gorgeous looks, are a lot more likely to break when you drop them, so the argument for using a case becomes much stronger.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that even cheap cases can give you drop protection by preventing you from dropping the phone in the first place. A lot of phones have particularly slippery backs, and a good case can add a bit of grip to keep it from sliding out of your hand and onto the concrete. It still isn't as good as getting a quality case, but it's better than going naked.\n\nProtection for More Than Just Cosmetics: Even if you don't care about the occasional scratch or even shattered back, there's more to your phone than that. Some phones (like the iPhone) have a camera lens flush with the back, meaning its much more prone to scratches and other damagewhich can make your photos look pretty awful. You could also damage one of the buttons on your phone, which would make it much more of a hassle to use than just a few scratches.\n\nResale Value: That said, even if you aren't obsessive about the little scratches on your phone, many people areand while dropping your phone without a case may not break it, it will create little nicks and scratches on your phone that will lower the resale value. Putting a case on your phone is one of the best ways to upgrade to your next phone for freeso if you sell your phones instead of keeping them around, a case can be a great idea.\n\nStand Out in a Crowd: While there's always an argument to make for \"individuality\", a case can also make you stand out in a practical way. Next time you're at a social gathering, count the number of people with the same phone as you in the room. Now imagine none of those people had cases on their phones, and left them on the table or counter (as so many people do). Have fun finding your phone in a sea of identical iPhones.", "summary": "such a nice sleek phone case", "unixReviewTime": 1472083200}

First off, the bottom of the silicon shell in the front of the case sometimes is slightly raised.  I don't think it can be helped as the design of the case doesn't really leave much room for more reinforcement.  This is a very minor thing that most people probably will not notice.  The second thing again is a part of the design that they probably can't fix.  This being that the opening around the TouchID sensor is open to allow for it's use.  This could allow dust particles to get between the screen the the screen protector.  The bottom line is that the OtterBox company is very easy to work with and they stand behind their products so for me that's worth the price  of admission.", "summary": "Another well-built product from OtterBox", "unixReviewTime": 1384300800}

This is the best smart phone on the market for the time being until iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy S3 releases. I had iPhone 4 for 2 months and I like many other people who could not be satisfied with beauty and fruit brand alone threw that 'dumb beauty' . For me that was more of a 'show off' rather than of practical use.\n\nApple itself in a recent patent suit directed against google termed this as the \"most creditable competitor to iPhone'. Apple co founder which is not a apple employee anymore and hence free to speak truth freely declared iPhone easy to use but 'Android more feature rich'. He dismissed Siri totally saying he could not understand how come internet could be needed to make a call through Siri. Do I need to say more now? If yes then here is the detail review:\n\nLike ->\n(1) Bigger HD contour display-> Though you can distinguish between pixels while looking closely unlike iPhone's Retina display, Nexus's display is gorgeous. Colors are very vibrant and rich. Black is real black (because of Super AMOLED display technology) which creates the whole difference.\nThe Screen is large and with medium hands I can reach to the whole screen stretching the thumb or fingers. Sometimes I tend to use the other hand (luckily I have two hands and both are fully functional so can't complaint).\n\nBecause of bigger screen this phone is more useful or convenient for what Apple invented iPhone for ie Browsing web, playing games, watching videos. And because of this I tend to depend lesser on PC/laptop/tablet. With bigger screen, power and customization of Android OS this phone is closer to our old friend PC/laptop.\n\n**I run the same HD video both on nexus and iPhone 4S and nexus one was better to watch.**\n\n(2) Soul-> The soul of this device is ICS OS which is now equal to iOS in terms of user friendlessness but is better because it is much more customizable and hence you feel completely in control and power. This is different feeling than using dumb iOS. After using ICS I really struggled to use the iOS or same iOS based apps. ICS is lightning fast and smooth.\nFace unlock, NFC, android beam and google wallet (not available on Verizon version) are very cool. Face unlock works perfectly.\nBuilt-in Data usage monitor is very helpful for not letting you go above your data limit.\n-> Mine is international unlocked version which within a week got automatically updated to 4.0.2 from 4.0.1.\nThis has Best notification, better customization for web browsing.\n\nOhhhhhhhh... did I tell you android has taken two steps which is miles ahead of time and going to change the things completely? (i) No Physical button-> The buttons are in fact part of OS itself and function well. Hence the buttons can now be context specific and smarter. They change their position depending on how you are holding the phone or what you are doing. While watching video they disappear completely giving you the whole screen for watching, and yes they will reappear on appropriate place when you need them. (ii) Same OS for all devices: Unlike Apple now same application can run on any device running on ICS. For apple the applications need to be written separately both for iPhone and iPad. That's why Apple has lesser applications on iPads. With new approach of ICS now people will just write once and run it anywhere hence number of apps is going to get multiplied faster on ICS.\n\n(3) Eco System (Apps)-> Android eco system (or app market) is there on par with Apple eco system. In the same period I have installed much more applications ($150-$200 of worth in Apple world AND YES ALL FREE!!!!!!!) than I did on iPhone 4 (because most applications are free compared to Apple). I am more functional on Android than I was on iPhone 4. There is nothing which I want and its not there. And yes now google going to start monitoring of applications so less argument against Android apps.\n(4) Form factor-> I like its form factor more than of iPhone's. Countered makes it more convenient to use and keep in the pocket. Now to me iPhone is just any another device and I look on iPhone with pity.\n(5) Battery-> I need to charge it once a day with low to moderate usage which is what other iPhone 4S customers are also doing. And if you are going to use it like laptop you will need to charge it more (is not this same with your laptop?). Better part is unlike iPhone you can carry batteries and change it easily. No complaint here.\n(6) Reception-> Decent.\n(7) Call quality-> Nice.\n(8) Volume/Speaker-> Low, could be helped with volume control plus application.\n(9) More social-> Very well integrated with google.\n(10). Build-> Except the battery cover everything else is of high quality. I don't care about plastic versus metal debate. iPhone even with metal and corning glass are equivalently fragile and people have been reporting iPhone being broken having dropped just from 12 feet or so. And with gorilla glass on both ends iPhone 4 is more fragile. Remember gorilla glass is just scratch resistant not damage resistant.\n(11) Typing-> is a breeze and it seems to read you mind and hence make typing a different experience than on iPhone. And big screen helps every here again.\n\nUnfortunately this phone decided to do have some deliberate suicidal traits perhaps to avoid wiping away other Samsung devices. So here are the things which could have been improved upon:\n(1) Speaker-> Could have been better (Minor+ issue)\n(2) Reception-> Though not much complaint, Could have been just a 'little' better (Very Minor issue).\n(3) Camera-> Could have been better definitely.\n(4) External Storage-> Either they should have allowed adding external storage or given the device with more alternated with respect to storage capacities. (Minor issue)\n(5) Display-> Should not be able to distinguish pixels (Minor issue but this should be ultimate goal for the display)\n\nConclusion-> This is the best smart phone on the market for the time being if you can live with some minor issue with volume. And all issues reported so far with this device seem to be software issues and should get corrected with updates or third part applications.", "summary": "Near to Perfect Smart Phone, overall better than any nearest Rival", "unixReviewTime": 1328313600}

It uses your lightning cable instead of many other companies using micro USB. Why do I want micro usb when I have a house full of iphone cables and chargers ? It doubles the battery life of your phone and charges the external battery in about the same amount of time it takes to charge the internal battery. The case is a little slick to the touch but after using it a week it is ok.\nThe case fits the iphone perfectly with all buttons working good.

Failure to position the lens correctly may cause some blurriness in your photos.  If your photos come out blurry, adjust your lens until you get a clear picture.  Each lens comes with a lens cover.

I was with Boost Mobile before, but decided to switch carriers because long story short, Boost is terrible and I was sick of them. Anyway, I've only been using the Samsung Galaxy Avant for a couple of days, but so far I really like it.\n\nPros:\n\n-Phone Runs Smoothly\n\n-Build Quality (Looks and feels nice)\n\n-16GB of Memory\n\n-Good Coverage (Where I am, at least)\n\nCons:\n\n-Battery Life (3-4hrs with heavy usage on full charge)\n\n-Display (It's has a decent size screen, but colors look a bit washed out/dull and the is resolution bit low)\n\nOverall, this phone is decent for the price. I'm satisfied with it at the moment and I will definitely update if I experience any issues. Also, I'm liking T-Mobile so far. I'm on the $80 unlimited everything plan (I'm a heavy data user) and everything is working great. I honestly don't know what their exact data speeds are, but when I'm web browsing everything loads quickly and YouTube videos play without buffering on normal quality.", "summary": "Pretty Good Overall.", "unixReviewTime": 1415836800}
