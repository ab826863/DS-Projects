Roman", "reviewText": "This is the nicest Air Hogs plane we have had by far.  The flight time on one charge is longer than the (probably about 15) other planes and helicopters that we have tried.  The plane crashed several times but was not damaged.  The plane/helicopter arrived charged and we flew it for about 20 minutes on the charge.  When the helicopter started losing height we recharged it for about 15 minutes and it flew for another about 15 - 20 minutes\nWhen hovering as a helicopter you are not able to move the device beyond spinning it so that it is facing the direction in which you would like it to fly.  The transformation takes place quickly when a button is pressed and when flying as a plane it is easy to control and maneuvers very nicely.  We were flying in a little bit of wind and it was much easier to control than our HobbyZone Scout is in very calm weather.  You can then convert back into a helicopter for landing by pressing the button again.\nWe received the plane to test and evaluate and it really exceeded our expectations. After the first two flight sessions my husband, son and I tried to guess what the price would be and the lowest guess was $99.  We were surprised when we looked up the actual price.  From a parents perspective this helicopter/plane is a huge improvement from the Air Hogs helicopters and planes we have had in the past.  The engineering and construction is very nicely done in comparison.  It is made of a foam that is like Styrofoam but much stronger and more flexible.  We have had about 5 other Air Hogs helicopters, which did not hold a charge as well, took a long time to charge and broke easily (and often with the first crash or two).  Our son loves helicopters and planes but we have had a hard time finding something for him to fly that he can control and is sturdy enough to get through the learning phase.  The fact that the battery charges quickly is great when you have an impatient and excited child.  So far we are very impressed by this device.\nMy 12 year olds review: This is really amazing and cool and awesome and I would really like to have more of them.  They fly well and the takeoff works nicely.  The transformation of the wings is very fast and the steering works well for the weight of the plane.", "summary": "Great choice for our 12 year old", "unixReviewTime": 1441929600}

The game includes enough pieces for up to 4 players to play at the same time, as well as game cards with patterns that range from easy to very difficult. I gave my daughter the easiest cards to start out with but she quickly caught on and moved up through the cards.  The object of the game is to find which pattern on the card is connected by the two small blocks and duplicate it exactly - it's a race to see who can duplicate their card first.  The patterns are true to size so if Emma is unsure which length is correct she can lay the rod directly on the card to be sure it's the right one.\n\nWhen we play together my husband and I take the hardest cards and give my daughter the easier ones, we count down to 0 and then GO!  It's a race to see who can find and duplicate their pattern first.  It's truly a blast!  I recommend this game - it has quickly become a family favorite because it is easy to pull out and play a few games then put away.  Because the pieces are small, it doesn't take up too much space, either.

We put in the (three AAA) batteries and charged it for 20 seconds, then let it go, and... it was really unimpressive. \"Nonstop stunt action?\" Hardly. But then I thought that maybe the batteries weren't as fresh as they could be. I changed to three new ones, and ZOOM! The motorcycle took off across the room and cracked us up. It was the little motorcycle that could. It rode over the rug, smacked into the door and rebounded, and all-around went crazy for 20 seconds. (We timed it a couple of times.) It's fast and funny action while it lasts, but it really does just last 20 seconds. Then it slows way down and comes to a complete stop around 40 seconds, and you have to charge it again. That gets tedious.\n\nThe other problem is that my daughter has a hard time lining up the little tab on the motorcycle bottom with the slot on the charger. It's tiny and requires decent motor skills to get it lined up.\n\nSo it's a novel way to charge rather than the \"roll-back and go\" method, and it kind of looks like a crazy rodent when it's bumping around and rebounding all over the place, but three batteries is a bit much and the charging method is not my favorite.", "summary": "Funny motorcycle", "unixReviewTime": 1380412800}

Each player is given six cards that say: A, B, C, D, Walk Away, or have the pictures of all the lifelines.  The player is then supposed to select the card that they wish to use based on the question.  Now, the questions don't stay up for long, rather they come up for maybe 20 seconds then they go away.  The question is read to you, though, so if you have trouble reading, this does make it easier to play the game.  After the question has been read, you are then asked if anyone chose to use a lifeline.  The problem with this is that only one player can use a lifeline per question.  Now, he can use more than one of his lifelines, but if more than one person wanted to use a lifeline, the second person is going to be out of luck.  The lifelines available in this game are 50:50, Ask the Audience, and Phone a Friend.  After the lifelines are used (or not) you are then told the answer to the question and asked if anyone got it wrong.  And after that question you have to answer the question of whether someone walked away.  Although these questions are vital to the gameplay, they slow it down and you are forced to answer them each question. There are a lot of questions in the game, though, and I have rarely had a repeat question in playing this game.  The questions range in difficulty from easy to hard, so there is a nice variety.  There is also variety in the styles of questions, they range from knitting questions to geography questions.\n\nOverall, this is a fun game to play with friends, but it has its tedious moments.  If you're willing to spend a large portion of the game answering whether players used lifelines or walked away then it can be quite an entertaining play.", "summary": "It wasn't thought all the way through before it was sold.", "unixReviewTime": 1273363200}

This makes them best for young kids, who probably don't have the patience or hand-eye coordination for a complex transformation process and want something quick and simple.  Older collectors, meanwhile, will probably be annoyed at the simplicity of these figures, and prefer the larger, more complex figures.\n\nI purchased the Grimlock one-step changer because I simply wanted an inexpensive figure of one of my favorite Transformer characters.  In this case, I find myself wishing I'd splurged on the larger figure instead.  Grimlock is TOO simple, and even at nine dollars is still too expensive for what you get.\n\nOne-Step Grimlock feels more like a glorified McDonald's Happy Meal toy than a true Transformers figure.  The plastic he's made of feels cheap, and he lacks any sort of movable joints.  I like figures that are at least somewhat posable, so to have what basically amounts to a statue instead of an action figure feels like a cheat.  His transformation basically consists of folding his legs back -- though his robot mode leaves a lot to be desired, so he'll probably be staying in dino mode on my shelf.\n\nI understand the one-step changers were made with kids in mind, but I get the feeling that even young children will quickly grow bored with a toy that can't be posed and has a single gimmick in place of an actual transformation.  And the fact that he costs anywhere from seven to ten dollars (depending on where you buy him) feels like a ripoff.

Good quality, just like basically all of the other DC Imaginext figures.\n\nThe Superman is the New 52 uniform, very similar to the one in the 2-pack with Wonder Woman.

All of Bandai's 2013+ kits are very detailed and articulated. You can get 90 degree or more bends out of the knee and elbow joints, which are double jointed. My 2 big complaints are 1: the decals are just stickers, not dry transfers or waterslides, so they will never look as good because of their outline.

My husband and I were eager to introduce this game to our 5-year-old and thought it would be a fun game to play with as a family. We did have fun, but the two adults (me and hubby) found the shoddy construction particularly deplorable.\n\nBasically, the game parts consist of two plastic tubes with a plastic connector in between. These three parts are to be manually attached together and stood on the game base which is also made of plastic. The plastic color sticks are then to be inserted through the little holes in the tube connector in a crisscross pattern which will serve to hold the marbles ( which are provided in the box).\n\nThe problems with this game are mainly due to the cheap plastic parts - they are so insubstantial and moving the canister (for each player's turn) is cumbersome as a result and inadvertently jolts the marbles even further. Luckily, my 5-year-old was patient enough with the careful manipulation during each player's turn, and we did have fun, but we found the overall experience to be underwhelming.", "summary": "Shoddy construction, though the game itself is fun", "unixReviewTime": 1271894400}

Please check out the videos on youtube on how this doll actually works, because when I've mentioned it to others, they assume it is the doll that wets and poops her diapers, requiring the special (pricey) diapers and baby food.  This doll DOES NOT pee, DOES NOT poop, and DOES NOT require special food or diapers which is why I love her.  This doll is very fun, totally functional, and completely clean!\n\nDoll comes with 1) 2 piece outfit; 2) \"magic bananas\" spoon; 3) \"magic bananas\" spoon; and 4) apple juice sippy cup (which does not actually drip juice from it but does give the appearance that the juice is disappearing during feeding.  The doll speaks when he tongue is activated by either the sippy cup or spoon and she says a large variety of adorable phrases.  She also speaks when you press her bracelet.\n\nThe best feature of this doll is how she eats her food (and why I recommend viewing a video of this).  When you place the spoon into the bowl, it \"magically\" fills up with yummy (plastic) bananas thanks to a tiny trigger on the back of the spoon which is triggered by the bowl.  When you bring the spoon to the dolls lips, the trigger is again activated and the food \"disappears\" giving the appearance that the doll has eaten the bananas.  I was concerned my 2.5 year old would have difficulties feeding the doll and filling the spoon in the manner needed to trigger the features, but she has had no trouble at all and thinks it's pretty amazing...as do I!\n\nI highly recommend this doll :)", "summary": "Love this doll!

Both are awesome.\n\nFirst of all, you should not buy this if you are not already familiar with the standard game of Risk and its rules. I feel like it could be much more confusing to learn all the original rules plus the extra rules this adds on top of it. You should also not buy this if you are not a Halo fan. It simply doesn't make sense. Half the fun of the game is recognizing various locations and unit models from the Halo universe. If you aren't familiar with that universe you'd be better served to get the standard Risk game (which is cheaper anyway). I wouldn't go buy a Kardashians Risk, for example, because I don't care about the Kardashians.\n\nOkay, so now we've established the target demographic. You are already a fan of Risk and Halo. You will really like this game. But the question is will you prefer this game or Halo Wars Risk? If you are an ultra-Halo-nerd like me, you can get both. Otherwise, I would say it depends on how much you are willing to bend the original rules of Risk.\n\nHalo Wars Risk has 3 races, Human (UNSC), Covenant, and Flood. It also adds the \"hero\" element to each team (Master Chief, Arbiter, etc), which gives you a slight edge on your dice rolls when your \"hero\" is in effect. But Halo Wars Risk has an identical map to the original Risk, except not. What I mean is, there is a perfect 1:1 mapping of the original Risk countries/continents/territories, but it has been completely restyled and rethemed to Halo. You would NEVER notice this if you weren't already a pretty big Risk nerd, since the continents to not resemble Earth's continents at all. Where it really reveals the similarities are the territory *borders*. In the south-east part of the game board, for example, you have a re-themed Australia, with only 3-4 territories and only one way in, worth an additional 2 units per turn when fully occupied. In the south-west is a re-themed South America, with 5-6 territories and two ways in (from North America and Africa), which is worth 3 additional units per turn. This ensures the well-thought-out and time-tested borders of the original Risk are preserved, without appearing to be the same game board.\n\nNow this Halo Legendary version keeps the \"hero\" and \"base\" elements of Halo Wars Risk along with the same 3 races of game pieces, but it completely scraps those traditional borders and territory layout. There are two physical game boards, each with two sides. You can mix and match these depending on how many people are playing and how you want to play. You can play a pretty quick one-on-one game by only using one game board. These are still pretty fun and help reduce your playtime from 3-5 hours to about an hour, for when you just don't have until 3am to play a game. Two connect the two small boards, this version adds \"mobile teleporter\" pieces. At the beginning of the game, players can each place one set of matched-number teleporters between any two territories. This can make each game different and change the dynamic of where everyone can attack and be attacked from.\n\nIf you flip the two small game boards over, you have a different map that is intended to be connected horizontally, for a very long game board which is supposed to be reminiscent of an actual Halo ringworld. This is quite fun as well, but requires a very big table or a lot of floor space, and preferably at least 4 players.\n\nThen there are some other game dynamics, such as the territory cards. Traditionally, you keep these until you are ready to trade them in for units. In Halo Legendary Risk, you can still do this, or you can trade the cards instead for various bonus features depending on what it says on the card. There are also mission cards ranked by Halo-style difficulty (Easy, Heroic, Legendary). You can use these or not, again depending on how close you want to stick to traditional Risk rules.\n\nThe game pieces and dice (black and green) are pretty cool. UNSC humans have Marines (1 unit), Scorpion Tanks (3 units) and a Spartan as their hero. Covenant gets Grunts (1 unit), Wraith (3 units) and Elite/Arbiter as their hero. Flood has the small flood spore (1 unit), Flood Carrier (3 units) and for the hero, the giant flood brute monster thingy I only really recognize from some levels in the actual Halo Wars game.\n\nOther than that, it's Risk. Roll dice, attack armies, capture territories. A fun, classic game, updated for all the Halo nerds out there.", "summary": "Another excellent variant of Risk for the Halo fan", "unixReviewTime": 1388016000}

Some parts were trickier than others to attach... not because of the directions, but because of their locations. I think it would be very helpful to have small, dainty fingers when putting this together because there were times when I found it rather difficult to get my medium sized female fingers into the tiny areas where these screws had to go, and not only that, but to hold the tiny washers in place at the same time. There are so many parts that it will take you hours and hours to put this together. It's recommended for age 10 and up but I cannot imagine a 10 year old being able to put this together by themselves. I put it together myself for my 8 year old, which was a shame because I would have liked for her to have been able to do it herself, or at least a lot of it herself as I think it would have been a rewarding experience for her to be able to see the end result of all her hard work. It's just too difficult though for a child to put together without help. I spent seven hours putting this together, only to get to the final part... assembling and attaching the feet, and realizing I had no long screws. I did purchase this as a \"wearhouse deal, in very good condition\". To me, that meant the box was damaged, not that it would be missing 16 or so screws. I'll be conscious of that next time I purchase an Amazon wearhouse deal. When I called Amazon they said they couldn't help me, so I called the company...Spin Master, located in Canada, and they were excellent. They immediately mailed out all the screws I need to finish this robot, at no cost to me. Unfortunately it will take at least a week to receive them in the US. I'm expecting to spend at least another two hours on just assembling and attaching the feet, although it may be less..that's just a guess judging by all the tiny screws and washers I still have left over that I'm guessing the instructions will tell me to use for the feet. It's an interesting toy, quite interactive and funny at times with his jokes and little remarks. He shakes hands, does hive fives, knows his name. That's about as far as we've got with him though..he doesn't always hear a command even when it's directed right towards the area you're supposed to speak into, and I do wish he was a little louder too...unless the room is very quiet, it's often difficult to hear what he's saying. We haven't been able to use the app with him...it just doesn't seem to be working, and it appears that if you want to use a phone with this, which you can attach to the front of him, you would need an iPhone. We cannot attach an Android phone, it's too big. Once I get the screws and can attach his feet and wheels, I think my daughter will enjoy this little guy. Just have patience, and put aside a day to put him together and you'll be fine.", "summary": "Long time to put together, but we like him", "unixReviewTime": 1470873600}

He also really likes things that are soft to the touch and always runs his fingers along things like his soft blanket. Since he's at that very tactile age and also loves his pacifier, I thought the Bop Buddie would be perfect for him!\n\nAt first I was disappointed when I got it because Jax only takes a pacifier that doesn't have a ring so there was nowhere to attach the Bop Buddie to. I had tried all different kinds with him and the ugly one from the hospital without a ring is all he wanted. I thought I would at least give it a shot and to my surprise he immediately took to the pacifier that came with the Bop Buddie. It was love at first sight!\n\nI was really surprised he liked the pacifier but so happy I tried it before writing it off! He loves it! He just holds onto the little lamb and touches it's soft ears and fur while he is sucking on his pacifier.\n\nIn addition to the baby loving the lamb and having a soft cuddly toy for comfort with him at all times, there are several benefits for me! His old pacifier used to disappear on me ALL the time. I was constantly on the hunt for the pacifier and it could be hiding in plain view because it was hard to see. This one is much harder to miss!\n\nThe other thing I really like is that if it drops (when it drops) it doesn't bounce off and disappear like the other ones. Those things can bounce! He also seems to drop this one less; maybe because he's actually holding onto the lamb whereas the other pacifier would just be sitting in his mouth so if he opened his mouth at all, it would fall out.\n\nThe one thing I don't like so much is that it's white so it's harder to keep clean. It does wipe off with warm water and mild soap as directed but I wonder how long I'll be able to keep it clean. Yesterday Lambie went to the beach with us and took some abuse from the sand!\n\nI'm surprisingly impressed with the Bop Buddie and all of the benefits that wouldn't have even occurred to me had I not tried it.

There are those who buy Star Wars toys to take them out and display, handle gently, and arrange it just so.  There are those who will buy the Star Wars toys and manhandle them like they were meant to be played with.  If you are in the last category, move along.  This toy will not handle the rigors of childhood.  Panels will snap off left and right, causing endless frustration.  This star destroyer was not designed to do battle.\n\nCount me in the second group.  I like to open my Star Wars toys.  After all, what's the point of buying a toy if it just sits in a box?  On the other hand, I don't really play with them so much as rearranging them on the shelf.  This is the toy for me.  What I love about it is the attention to detail.  I placed the figures and ship under a digital microscope to take photos and was amazed that something the size of the tip of my finger could have so much detail.\n\nThe ship itself did not require much assembly.  Just place two pieces together.  There was one sheet of stickers, but they are small stickers and it took me awhile to place them.  I wish they would have put the stickers on for me, because I made some mistakes and can't get them on perfectly.  There is one piece I think I need to superglue down, but I think it will be fine once I do that.\n\nThe ship opens up to look sort of like a set on a movie.  A cannon unfolds and shoots one laser.  There's a plastic rod that hangs an X-wing above the cannon, so I presume we should imagine that laser is coming from the X-wing. Great for displays.  When the ship is closed, it holds all the small pieces except for the TIE fighter.\n\nSpeaking of small pieces, they are not metal like I expected.  They are very pliable plastic.  I love those pieces.  When you see the detail, you will, too.", "summary": "Adults Only -- Not to be Played With", "unixReviewTime": 1445299200}

The Ecto-1 and 1A from GB 1 and 2. They are quite stunning. I was not expecting the level of paint details on the roof equipment of either.

Ecto-1A is particularly sharp with all the extra paint and tampo detailing. Not perfect, but quite good for the scale and price.\n\nThe only negatives I can give it; The Pearl White metalic paint is a little too overdone and obvious. They might have been better served with a simple gloss white. And the lightbars use metalic paint rather than transclear parts. Granted the paint does catch the light and give acceptable results for the lightbars.\n\nOverall this is probably the single best product offering tied to the new Ghostbusters reboot movie.

He's enjoyed the \"Cars\" and original \"Planes\" movies SO much, as well as the diecasts we've collected for him.  We understand Pinecone is a member of the \"Smokejumpers\" (along with leader Dynamite, Avalanche, Blackout and Drip), a ground crew that's transported via an ex-military plane called Cabbie and parachutes down to clear debris caused by wildfires.  Pinecone is an easygoing Southern gal who has a handy rake, and recalling how much our grandson loved a construction crew called \"The Pack\" during his Thomas the Train phase, I know this group of characters will become new favorites when Christmas rolls around!  One thing that should be noted is that Pinecone's rake doesn't actually move on this diecast model.\n\nPinecone is one of the good-sized Smokejumpers, measuring @ 3-1/4\"L, 2\"W, 2\"H.  The 1:55 scale Mattel models have become our preference based on our experience over the past few years.  They have more of a sturdy plastic feel, and now that we have a 2 year old grandson as well who is a lot rougher on toys than our older one was, durability is our primary consideration (especially since we have another grandson making his debut around Labor Day)... with three boys to make it through (and hopefully GREAT grandchildren someday!), the toys we buy have to be tough.  The Disney Store models we've purchased were larger (1:43 scale) and had a heavier metal concentration, but LOOK OUT if they rolled off of the coffee table - parts were breaking off like crazy.  The Mattel collections have held their own.  Pinecone is included in the Welcome to Piston Peak 7 pack (the ONLY multipack with ALL FIVE Smokejumpers!) and a 3 pack with model # CLJ30.

Christensen", "reviewText": "I bought Spyrium at a discount so I wouldn't feel too bad if I never played it twice.  Turns out to be exactly what most people say it is: a good medium-weight worker-placement/resource-management game with a superficial steampunk theme.  The wooden meeples look just like those from Carcassonne, and the artwork is decent if uninspiring.  Cards are good quality, and the green spyrium crystals are fun.  All of that aside, the economy of decisions is the real draw for this type of game, and Spyrium is a good example of the genre.\n\nIt's a board game without a board, other than a small scoring track.  This plus the 3 x 3 \"market\" of buildings, characters, and technique cards gives Spyrium a relatively small footprint.  Two people can sit side-by-side and play this on a coffee table, since everything is visible to all other players.  With 5 players it was a different experience.  Spyrium has a mechanic that allows you to earn money when you choose to remove workers from the board, so with 12 to15 meeples crowding the market, you can accumulate a lot of money more efficiently than with 2 players.  The turns are relatively short, since you only have a few options.  Expect a complete game to last about 25 minutes per player.\n\nAs a personal preference, I like games with scoring tracks.  Like most worker-placement games, Spyrium gives players the chance for a big point grab at the end, so a player could jump ahead by 10 points on the track during the game, and still find themselves beaten by someone who chose a strategy for the \"long game\".  My game group plays a lot of Carcassonne, Puerto Rico, and Lords of Waterdeep.  Spyrium is a little different from any of these and went over really well.

I really liked the Revoltech Stormtrooper and I like this Boba Fett for much of the same reasons, fantastic sculpt and articulation and accessories. But the qc issues with both figures makes me think that I will be passing on any future releases in this line.\n\nSo the sculpt, amazing. And the sculpt is enhanced by the stellar paint job, no bleeding or smudges on these paint applications. You get his Blas Tech EE-3 Blaster rifle, that although it doesnt have dry brushing on the barrel like the Hasbro Black Series Fett, I think this has a better all-around paint job. This rifle has a good feature too, the stock can be pulled up so you can slide the handle into the figures hand without having to force it in and break something. You also get Fetts Sacros K-11 disintegrator pistol that can be holstered in a nice soft rubbery holster unlike the hard plastic on the Revoltech Stormtrooper. Boba Fett comes packaged with fisted hands and included are two relaxed palms for holding the barrel of his rifle, and two trigger fingered hands. Now here is another issue I have, instead of getting a right and left trigger hand, I got two right triggered hands, not cool. The pictures on the back of the box show right and left trigger hands, and why would you want two of the same hand? Obviously I was supposed to get a right and a left, I wonder what other dude got two left trigger hands? Hit me up, maybe we can trade so we actually have the correct set of hands!\n\nHere are some other issues I have with the figure, the right leg is longer than the left. It has nothing to do with the Revoltech joints, I pulled this figure apart (which is actually easy to do and kinda cool that you can unplug all of the limbs and move around the joints if you want to line them up better/differently) and the right leg is a few millimeters longer than the left, making it impossible to stand this figure without having to bend the right leg or pose it. So I cant get him to stand just straight legged, annoying. The tips on the end of his boots are pointy for stabby kicking action, and also fragile breaking action. Im not sure if this was broken before I took him out of the box or not, but since the package is hassle free, Im not sure how or when I broke off one of the boot tips or if it was packaged broken, lame. Also, his cape shouldn't be green, this is the Empire Strikes Back version of Fett and so it should be beige with a brown stripe. If this were the Jedi version with red gauntlets, then it should have the green cape. And I think I would have preferred a soft goods cape and not soft plastic like this. I know people don't like the look of the joints but for me that isn't an issue. Fragility and breaking parts is my biggest issue with figures and this figure line in general.\n\n I know it sounds like Im bashing this figure but other than some valid issues, I really like this figure. I think in terms of design and paint, this kills the Black Series version, especially in articulation. I like that his antenna on his helmet articulated, I like the accessories and aesthetic of the figure, its just the qc issues mainly that kept this from getting a 5 star rating. If the figure was only $20-$30 it would get a 5 star rating. If I got the correct set of hands Id be able to forgive the tiny broken foot tip and slightly longer leg. Unless you're a die hard Boba Fett fan, you may want to pass on this due to the price and chances that youll have issues with yours as well. Still, this figure comes APPROVED.", "summary": "Revoltech Boba Fett", "unixReviewTime": 1433721600}

This set is one that is geared at the much younger toddler.  The bloks are large and work well with other First Builder sets but are too big for the average Megablok or Duplo.\n\nThe food truck is larger than I had originally expected but in line with other First Builder sets.  This does not take the place of a toy kitchen as it is too small for that purpose.  When my granddaughter (who is under one year old) wants to play with the blocks, we place it on the ground.  She can crawl to it, sit by it, and even use it as a support to stand up next to.  She is only interested in chewing on the blocks.\n\nTo make it more versatile, we have placed it on a small folding table so my three year old grandson can play with it standing up.  He is more interested in cooking and loves all the cooking related items in the set.  He helps his Mommy and Daddy cook at home and wants to be able to cook for Nana and Papa when he comes to visit.\n\nIn the end, I found it a good toy.  My only issue had to do with the size and purpose.  The size is appropriate for a younger child where the purpose is better for an older one but it is too small on its own for the older child.  Setting it on the table solved that issue for us.", "summary": "Fun set of food related Megabloks - grandkids love to play with it together", "unixReviewTime": 1479686400}

Rarely do we see original takes on classic fairytale characters in doll form other than Disney's adaptations in the market today.\n\nLittle Mermaid from Once Upon a Zombie is a really beautiful take on Andersen's character with a fun twist; she's been zombified! She has a beautiful face with rooted eyelashes, blue eyeshadow, green inset eyes, pale blue lips and delicate stitching running down her cheeks. Her hair, although not the best of quality, is still soft out of the box and is parted and styled quite nicely. The doll's look really works well in context with the tragic fairytale of \"The Little Mermaid\".\n\nLittle Mermaid's body and articulation are also top quality with 11 points of articulation. All parts of her body are sturdy and are nicely articulated. Aesthetically, her body looks really good. She has this pale greyish skin and a few delicate stitching details. I'm glad they didn't go overboard with the stitching details which would have come off gaudy had they done so. Another really great feature of her body is that she has fuller features like her torso and arms. She's a zombie but has a much more healthy looking body than many other dolls in the market. Ironic.\n\nCostume-wise is where Little Mermaid slightly disappoints but at the same time impresses. Little Mermaid has a pretty starfish accessory for her hair which is a really nice touch. Her top is the best feature of her costume. She has a molded seashell top that looks fantastic, a mermaid seashell top done right. So often fabric is used for seashell tops on mermaid dolls and they don't look nearly as good as this molded top. Now, where Little Mermaid slightly disappoints also happens to be the most important part of her costume, her fishtail. The polka dot fabric just doesn't look very good and it's only half a fishtail with her legs being exposed...why? It doesn't make much sense and it doesn't look good. It would have been really nice if she had a proper mermaid fishtail with her fins being jagged as if ripped like a real fish. I mean in the context of the fairytale I get it. It seems as if she was in the middle of her human transformation but it would have been much nicer if she had a proper fishtail.\n\nOverall, a wonderful doll with the only disappointment being her mermaid fishtail. Little Mermaid has a gorgeous face, lovely hair, a great body,one of the best doll mermaid tops, and a really nice starfish accessory. I love her color scheme, the blue makeup and blonde hair work very well for her. She's a very original and pretty take on Andersen's character. Although Fairy Tale High's Little Mermaid is a really nice doll, I can't help but wish her design was more original like Once Upon a Zombie's Little Mermaid. I look forward to the web-series and more dolls from this line! It'd be really cool if non-zombie versions were also released, based from the web-series trailer the fairytale princesses also have beautiful non-zombie character designs.", "summary": "The Little Zombie Mermaid!", "unixReviewTime": 1382400000}

Lutz", "reviewText": "Beast Hunters Bulkhead is one cool Autobot! I will admit this is the one deluxe beast hunters transformer I was most skeptical about,but I took a chance on it and am glad I did because this is one really good version of Bulkhead overall. The paint job with the green and gold really look cool with the reptilian scale armor. I like the the visor look on the head piece as well. Bulkhead also comes with one sweet weapon in a spinning Dragon Grinder that attaches to either the forearm or back in robot mode and securely on the roof or doors in armored truck mode. The spinning action on the weapon is very cool for a more realistic effect and is very easy to operate. The poseability is outstanding with great stability for creating cool battle scenes or displaying where you please. The durability is excellent as well with secure ball joint construction and a solid build in either mode. All parts fit together securely during the transformation process for a quality constructed transformer all around. The transformation level is intermediate meaning if you have plenty of experience with transformers there is mid-level difficulty. If you are a parent buying for a child of 5-6 you might need to assist some in the transformation process. First off the side pieces on the hood will slide in as the roof piece with the doors on the back rotates forward over the head. Next the arms rotate around so the fist are facing outwards. Now the forearms rotate in as do the fists. The arms will have the look like Bulkhead is flexing his muscles. The arms will rotate down and then in. The wheels will then slightly rotate out as the bottom section rotates forward. The front piece with the autobot symbol rotates down as the front fender and grill connect together. The autobot symbol piece rotates back up as the hood piece with the roof and doors will rotate forward to connect together. Next is the only real tricky part. You have to get the arms just right for everything to connect together. Basically the arms will be in a v-shape with the fist facing down with the knuckles on the outside. The doors will rotate down as the feet pieces will rotate in. The legs now connect together then will rotate up to form the back section of the armored truck. The doors now connect into place and Bulkhead is ready to roll out! If you are a fan of the Autobot bruiser Bulkhead this is a worthwhile transformer to add to your world of transformers. Bottom line Transformers Beast Hunters Bulkhead is a high quality,well-made,10 out of 10 transformer all fans will enjoy. I highly recommend Transformers Beast Hunters Bulkhead to all transformers fans and collectors out there.

This little heli flies great and is very responsive. It's capable of fast forward flight as well as very stable hovers when trimmed correctly and flown indoors. The frame is very light and very durable. The landing struts are very flexible so it's highly unlikely to break. The main rotor blades are very durable too. The tail boom is a carbon square rod which keeps the tail rotor at a near perfect vertical position. Parts are readily available and cheap too. Compared to my Walkera it's much more responsive given that all up weight is less due to the smaller battery and all plastic head/swash plate/flybar. It's also much more durable as parts just flex instead of getting bent or broken. The radio is pretty nice for the price. It's 2.4GHz and it has a backlit LCD with digital trims and get this..a Dual Rate button! Switching the D/R on/off allows the servos' throw to be decreased/increased respectively. Also this transmitter seems to be the same one used on the Align T-Rex 100 combo and that radio alone sells for around $60!\n\nWith that said it wasn't perfect out of the box as mine had a tendency to lean to the back/right. I had to adjust the right roll (aileron) trim to the max and the forward pitch (elevator) trim halfway to get it to hover in one spot. Being a somewhat experienced R/C hobbyist I disconnected the ball links to make adjustments to the length of the rods so that when the trims were at dead center the heli would hover without the need for significant trim adjustments. I've flown this heli outdoors on slightly breezy days and it flies fine and I'm not even that great of a pilot. On a related note the gyro holds the heli solidly which helps a lot. I would've given this package 5 stars if the heli didn't have to be trimmed to the max in order to hover.\n\nUpdate: After about 10 flights I noticed that the antenna on the heli came loose as the solder joint was not soldered correctly. Since I had a soldering iron and some solder handy I fixed it and it's flying great again however it's good advice to check your solder joints on your heli after you buy these as the quality control can be hit or miss. I've already ordered a second one of a different color and 5 larger capacity 150mah LiPo battery packs. That should get me about 1 hr of flying time (8 min per battery + 7 min each stock battery) with brief breaks for battery changes. The stock battery gives 7 minutes of indoor hovering..not bad at all.\n\nImportant tip: If your heli suddenly starts to spin wildly after many normal flights, check the tail motor/rotor for hairs/lint stuck on the motor shaft...ask me how I know. Not only will your heli not be able to hover but the tail motor will get very hot and may burn out if there are hairs/lint stuck around the shaft. Luckily I noticed it early enough on my heli as the motor did get hot!", "summary": "Fast, responsive, stable, low cost and durable (Updated Review with maintenance tip at the end)", "unixReviewTime": 1344124800}

Attack mode (RED EYES):  Aim the spider at your destination (preferably little sister or sleeping cat) and put on the floor.  The spider goes in a straight line until he makes contact with said object.  Little sister smashes spider and you have to buy a new one.  Planned obsolescence.\n\n2.  Creek mode (BLUE EYES):  Spider slowly rolls around to explore immediate surroundings.  Good for when you put him in the included cage.\n\n3.  Explore mode (GREEN EYES): Random exploration of a larger area.\n\nThis toy is not a $100 Roomba.  There are no edge sensors so yes it will fall down stairs, but mine fell down and no harm done.  Also there is no sensor to tell when it has hit a wall, so it just keeps pushing against the wall until the random program sends it in a different direction.  On the latter point it would be nice if it sensed the wheels were locked up and immediately switched into another mode, and would make play more fun because the spider could back up if you touch it and block it's way.  That would add more realism to the play.\n\nOn the bottom there is an \"on off\" switch, two wheels, the battery compartment, and of course the MADE IN CHINA stamp.\n\nAs for the battery, one star off.  It would be great if this were rechargeable or used more commonly available batteries.  It requires THREE \"button cell AG13 LR44 battery and I'm guessing that you, like me, have never heard of that type and don't have them around the house.  If this is a gift you might want to order some extras.\n\nOverall a fun toy, one star off for the strange battery and inability to backup immediately when it hits a wall, but other than that this will provide your kids or your pets with a lot of fun play.", "summary": "Whole family loves it including the cat.

But as I indicated with the note in my return (afraid I would not get a return for sending back less than 75, since I got less than 75) -- mom just doesn't have time for the quality control for this company.\n\nI'm off to find a new, more reliable, less costly, better quality supplier of Nerf style bullets and would recommend anyone else save your time and hard earned $$'s and do the same.", "summary": "Got less than 50 and those were really bad quality. .

There are just a few notes that I want to share with others who may be considering this item. These are not necessarily complaints, I'm not whining....I'm just sharing information to hopefully save the next consumer some time.  :)\n\n1. The knobs and \"timer\" on the front aren't real. Not a big deal, but it just may not be clear to someone just looking at the pictures on the box.\n2. You push the cake pan in one side, and then out the other the other side when it is done....everything only goes one way.\n3. Since the exit door only opens one way, you unfortunately can't push the pan back into the oven if you find that your cake is not done after the recommended time. You also can't put it back into the original entrance because the entrance slot is smaller than the exit slot, so ANY rise of the cake makes it too big to fit back in.\n3. You can't see into the oven to see if it is done or not. I wish we could see when the middle of our cake is runny and not nearly done. Sometimes we have to pop our cakes into our toast over to finish them off.\n4. I was using a recipe that I found online for Easy Bake cakes using ingredients you have at home. This is definitely the way to go, but it takes some experimentation to figure out how much to use. Of our first 5 cakes all of them either overflowed or got the tops scraped off as we pushed them out of the oven. (The recipe I used says to combine 1/3 cup of the dry mix with 4 tsp water for one little cake; however this proved to be too much...I ended up finally using about 1/4 cup dry + 3 tsp water instead to avoid crazy overflow messes inside the Easy Bake oven and to avoid a too tall cake for the allotted exit space.)\n5. I would recommend filling the little pan LESS than half full, and remember to butter and flour the pan so the cake won't stick.\n6. As far as cooking time, 12 minutes is what is recommended in the instruction book, but I needed 17 minutes to cook the most successful cake using the recipe I mentioned above.\n7. My daughter especially likes the little warming trays in the side of the Easy Bake oven for melting chocolate chips (for dipping strawberries, etc.)\n8. All in all, my daughter really likes the Easy Bake Oven and she gets a lot of help from me while we are figuring out the tricks to make this toy successful. It probably would be a mistake to expect a young child to be able to use it alone.\n\nA few more discoveries:\n9. It is not easy clean out the cooked-on overflowed batter from the inside of the Easy Bake Oven.\n10. One helpful tip: if we cook the cake for about 12 minutes then unplug the oven, but leave the cake inside the cooking area of the oven (for about 5-6 more minutes) while the oven is cooling down, it lets the cake settle a little so it is less likely to get the top scraped off of it when we push it out.", "summary": "Works ok, but some experimentation needed", "unixReviewTime": 1395532800}

I received this set free from Tryazon and Guidecraft in exchange for hosting a party and offering an honest review. All opinions and experiences are honest and my own. We had a party and children ages 3-11 used the IO Blocks to build. We used the included Build Cards - which are sturdy, colorful, and two-sided. We also built using our imaginations. This was the kids' favorite part! Some of the provided projects were simply too complicated for this age group. As a parent/homeschool mom, this is actually an awesome feature - these blocks will be great for hands-on thinking and learning until at least age 15. I can see my daughter building structures and using them for STEM projects for many years. They are sturdy, durable and the color is great. They connect well, but provide the opportunity for movement [great if you decide to use them for stop-motion animation projects!]. They could easily be mixed and mingled with other textiles [like playdough] for even more imaginative play and projects.\n\nThe only current drawback to these building blocks are that they come with a free app that just isn't quite up to par yet. The augmented reality app allows the builder to look up about 20 different build projects and see how they're put together. It is great to be able to see how the pieces of more complicated projects come together, especially if you find yourself stuck. However, right now, not every Build Card is included in the app and that left some of the children upset and frustrated. I think there is a lot of room for the app to grow, but the app is an add-on that is not vital to the enjoyment of these blocks!\n\nThere are an endless variety of ways to use these blocks for teaching and learning. They are recommended for ages 4 and up and I would agree. I think they're a great investment for any classroom. The children I partied with would agree. They said they would choose these blocks over any others if given the choice! They loved the colors, shapes, and puzzleyness of the blocks.", "summary": "Endless building and learning options!

The clip takes batteries to power a UV light that makes the special darts glow in the dark. This glow in the dark feature works well and has an on/off switch to save battery life when you are firing in the day.  The gun itself seems underpowered when compared to others such as the Stampede.  The mechanism requires you to hold down a button to power a motor before you can pull the trigger and actually fire a dart.  If the motor button isn't held down long enough then the darts are not fired with enough force to really be fun.  To make matters worse as the batteries deplete the gun fires with even less force making it useless in a Nerf gun battle.

I built Bandai's excellent 6'' R2-D2 and C-3PO, but I hadn't gotten any ships from The Force Awakens yet. Unfortunately, Bandai's ship models are difficult to get in the U.S. due to a licensing dispute with Disney, so I decided to try Revell's out offerings. Poe Damerons X-Wing isn't my favorite ship, but it seems like itll be one of the main ships in the new movie, so I decided to try it out.\n\nFirst of all, this is only a model in a very loose sense. The pieces aren't attached to a rack so there's no cutting required. All the pieces snap together very easily. In fact, the entire construction took less than 10 minutes. So I wouldn't really recommend this for anybody looking for an involved build. In terms of difficulty, it's probably suited more to younger kids.\n\nThat said, the final product is a really nice version of Poe Damerons X-Wing. The ship is over 8 inches long. Its not as large as Hasbros X-Wing, but this model uses nice, hard plastic (these laser cannons won't bend) The ship itself is very detailed. The wings expand so the ship can go into attack formation and the cockpit opens. The interior is quite detailed, but sadly theres no figure. Best of all - and this was a surprise to me - the ship comes with pretty good sound effects!\n\nThe model comes partially prepainted, at least the major features like the orange stripes and the cockpit windows. It doesnt have any weathering or scoring, but I decided this ship looked better clean (I added a tiny bit of weathering inside the engine intakes).\n\nThe ship unfortunately isn't entirely accurate to the film because the tips of the laser cannons are sideways. Although Im disappointed, I cant say it takes away too much for me. I wouldnt even have noticed if another reviewer hadnt pointed it out. Truth be told, I actually prefer the laser cannons sideways. I realize this is reason enough for some people not to get the model, so hopefully Revell fixes this in the near future.\n\nAnother (tiny) complaint is that the model doesn't include a stand. It does have landing gear, which works well enough, but a stand would still have been nice to so we could display the ship in mid-flight.\n\nIf you're looking for a movie-accurate model/toy of Poe Damerons X-Wing, this is a good choice. It's certainly great value for your money. I remember getting the Action Fleet version of Luke Skywalkers X-Wing during the 1990s. It cost about $10-15, wasn't as accurate, and didn't have sounds. So $20 for this kit is a bargain.", "summary": "build your own Star Wars toy", "unixReviewTime": 1446940800}

I will definitely be using this as a gift for birthday parties and the like for other boys in the 1-2.5 age range.\n\nIn terms of a choking hazard, the toy manufacturer rates this for 12-months or older.  I think that is just something that Amazon puts up to satisfy our liability-crazed social standards.  There is NOTHING I can see on this that looks to be a choking hazard, save for a snap or a 1\" button on the pants (also a snap on the hat), but these are sewn on very well, and I am not sure a 1\" button could cause choking on a 1-year plus child (though I'm sure there's some case in which it somehow did, hence the liability warning).  Ironically, by age 3, this toy would not be interesting/useful for most kids, who would have-- by then-- learned to dress themselves!\n\nFinally, in terms of the lace being sewed on, this is just like the hat.  With a pair of scissors, both the shoe lace and that hat are removed (as is intended) so that the child can play with the full set of clothes.

It is both excellent and sub-par.\n\nThe Thunder Megazord is unique in the line of Power Rangers and Super Sentai because of it's core design.  Other entries in the series work with a very familiar practice; five-to-six components, one or two which make up the central frame while the other four snap on to become arms and legs regardless.  Bandai has further adapted this into a universal system called the \"Zord Builder\" series, effectively making components from other configurations compatible.  For instance, components of the Samurai Megazord in the Zord Builder series can be combined with the Legacy Tigerzord.  These two things, the Thunder Megazord's unique design, and the Zord Builder series, are why the product figuratively and literally falls apart.\n\nThe core component of the Thunder Megazord configuration is the Red Dragon.  It converts to a humanoid form, with arms and legs.  It is fairly articulate.  The design of the Thunder Megazord deviates from the Zord Builder series because the remaining four components do not snap on to the torso, rather the central piece wears them like armor.  The Red Dragon's legs are inserted into the Pegasus and Griffen.  The Lion is worn on the arm like sleeves or gloves, whereas the Firebird wraps around the midsection.  This is a fantastic design that makes it stand out among others in the product line.\n\nHowever, the Legacy Thunder Megazord is also part of the Zord Builder line, which means certain backward-forward compatibility has to be forced.  The Legacy Tigerzord, which the Thunder Megazord should naturally be compatible with (as they are part of the same family / show) connects rather haphazardly.  The Tigerzord relies on the Zord Builder principle.  In order to accomplish this, rather than easily snap-in the other components for the arms and legs, pieces must be removed; pieces which some may not be entirely comfortable removing.\n\nIn order to properly combine this with the Legacy Tigerzord, first one must remove the toes/rear-legs of the Tigerzord.  These snap-in but they can be stubborn and working too stiffly may or may not cause damage to the small plastic molding which would otherwise hold them into place.  The Griffen and Pegasus each have a long, silver plate which needs to be removed so the pieces can align properly.  This came off easily on one of the pieces but required some work on the other.  This is not the entire assembly, mind you, this is simply the lower body.  In order to connect two pieces to the lower body four pieces have to be removed.  And set aside.  And not lost.  Ever.\n\nThe standalone Legacy Thunder Megazord looks fantastic, and after working with it I can understand why it was so expensive as it had to look great but also fit a square peg into a round hole.  It is only when expansion or customization is taken into account that it becomes problematic.\n\nIt is a must for collectors, but might be frustrating.", "summary": "Great by itself.", "unixReviewTime": 1455408000}

Acuff", "reviewText": "20+ years ago, we played Trivial Pursuit over and over and over again. Everybody was able to play and everybody was able to answer some questions because they were mostly based on general knowledge and trivia.\n\nNot so anymore!  If a player is not extremely well-read and informed, they will be very bored because the questions are VERY difficult for the average person. If you don't play the \"Easy\" mode, you will be \"playing\" all night waiting for a question to answer.  The first time I played, we \"got through it\" and the second time, with a larger group, we gave up.  Nobody wants to \"play\" something and not be able to \"play.\"\n\nThe set-up, design and concept of the game is nearly identical in the electronic version.  However, the digital \"cards\" -- because that's all that changed, is the cards are now in a hand-held digital contraption -- do not include the familiar categories and the navigation is cumbersome.  It is a three-step process to skip an insanely difficult question.  The categories are repeated.  The screen will show you, for example, Sports and Leisure I for yellow and Sports and Leisure II for green.  With nothing being different about how to play using the digital contraption, I say it's a waste of technology.  It would be better if, say, you land on blue and you choose blue (let's say its History) on the screen, then the screen would give the player a choice of questions in categories of Children's questions; Teen questions; World History, U.S. History, etc.\n\nBottom line.  Questions are too difficult for average people.  The digital contraption adds NOTHING to the game.  Definitely not nearly as enjoyable as it was many years ago.  It's not a family game, unless you are a family made up of only genius-level knowledge and trivia seekers.  Even then, don't expect many non-savant people under the age of 21 to be able to answer even one question.\n\nI dont' even know if I want to keep the game I bought for me -- much less the second game I bought as a potential gift.", "summary": "All Players Must Be Brainiacs", "unixReviewTime": 1262476800}

They're fragile and they can easily fail to work and break irrepairably.  They can also be very costly in purchase price and in the investment of time and materials put into building a layout.  I won't extol all the virtues of model railroading but obviously it includes art in the scenery, science in the electrics and electronics, social science and even economics in modeling society and industry.  So they are much more than a toy and can become a life-long hobby or avocation for an interested person.  One way to get started is to research and buy the good stuff, not wasting your time and money on junk like this LL set.  But if you over estimate your child's readiness to work with a model versus a toy, your mistake can be costly.  You may also not appreciate what modeling takes in terms of how much work it is, how much space it takes, how much is involved in terms of skills and learning.\n\nThis train set has got to be the rock-bottom cheapest HO set out there.  If not, it's real close.  The weaknesses abound.  I won't elaborate on them all.  The train is not accurate to the prototype (the real thing#.  It's made with poorly detailed plastic shell.  The engine's motor is cheap, won't slow-start but jumps, won't run slowly, won't stop slowly but jerks to a halt.  The cars are too light #they feel like an empty egg shell) and easily derail.  The controller only has one DC circuit and one AC and a poor potentiometer type twist throttle that is hard to regulate.  The track is very phoney-looking black molded plastic and code 100 rail.  Code 100 has very tall metal rails that are easier to manufacturer carelessly and hold trains well but look far too tall for scale.  If you \"get into it\" you won't re-use this track but instead you'll want some code 83 track or to hand lay your own code 70 or 55.  Still, the track and the rest of this set is so cheap, you can't beat it to have something almost 'disposable' to get started with and learn all the hard lessons.  It's like learning to drive in a beater.\n\nThe LL set I have doesn't have the plastic road bed.  This is a big improvement for durability in play.  Without the plastic road bed, you have to nail the track to a foam or cork road bed on a sheet of MDF or something or the track will easily break.  The plastic road bed is, of course, completely phoney for scale modeling and is a concession to the toy aspect of this product.  For a toy, I like the Fisher Price Trackmaster trains better.  They're bullet proof, both the engines and the track.  The durability is amazing and yet they're slightly bigger and better detailed than the wooden railways and less expensive.  I do prefer wooden railways for their craftsmanship though, particularly the older Swedish made Brio and the modern Thomas ones.  Another awesome toy to check out is the Lego trains.  They're quite costly with the power options but have two big advantages for play in that they're able to be totally customized, and they integrate with the whole Lego play system.\n\nSo their your have it.  If you want to try scale model railroading, this LL set is a cheap start and you'll learn plenty on your way to a rather sophisticated endeavor.  If you're looking for a toy, try Trackmaster for children 6 and under, and Lego trains for older children.  The play value is far better with either of those.  Of course, when I was six, I had to have the 'real' thing.  I got an N scale model and loved it.  If your child is attracted to the scale realism, no mere 'toy' will suffice.", "summary": "Perfect to test scale or HO toys with kids", "unixReviewTime": 1290988800}

Before I go on, I must say that this is not a game for those who do not like rules!! There are essentially two rulebooks; one is a game walkthrough and the other gets into more of the details of the rules as well as the scenarios, and each of them is about 20 pages long! However, I had one of the most gratifying board game experiences once I started to grasp them as well as the flow of the game. The mechanics of the game are not hard to learn, there is just a lot of moving parts and a lot to know. The first scenario really helps you understand what is going on.\n\nI just have to say it felt epic! I have only played one scenario, and I played it solo (to get a grasp of the rules before teaching it to others), but I really enjoyed it and I felt like there was so much depth to the game. This game is truly unique; I have yet to play a fantasy game like it. It is not a dungeon crawler like Descent. Instead it is a game of recruiting army units, pillaging villages, using magic to power special abilities, fighting monsters in dungeons, overtaking cities and keeps and exploring (you lay tiles and actively build your world). You power your actions and movements with cards and magic. While all of this is going on you are leveling up your character and developing new skills. Many fantasy games have aspects of these, but the scope of this game is part of what makes it so unique. I highly recommend it if you are not afraid of rules and taking time to understand the game.", "summary": "A unique, epic fantasy adventure", "unixReviewTime": 1454025600}

As a consumer I truly appreciate the \"no frills\" packaging and speedy shipping because I feel like my money went toward a better product and more of it. I compared other rock/gem assortments and by far I believe that this is the highest quantity of rocks you will get for your money. The rocks are in a simple ziploc bag that comes in a very small cardboard box. No air in there to fill with inflated bags or other packing material. The informational material is straightforward and easy to read and with very little instruction small children can easily identify each of the rocks on the enclosed chart, even if they're not yet able to read the names of each rock.  The added bonus of the meteorite, that interacts with the magnetic hematite, put this over the top for me.

It's solid wood with metal hinges -- really well made.  They are a million screws, hinges, bolts, etc (see pic), and the lengthy assembly process includes about an hour of attaching all the hardware.  The company includes a bunch of extra hardware, too.\n\nThe final product weighs 47 lbs -- sturdy and solid. It also comes with a strap to attach it to the wall, which I'd suggest if you have a climber like I do.\n\nMy son loves this kitchen. He makes beeping noises as he presses the microwave buttons, and he loves to pretend to drink water from the faucet.  The sink is a bit small, so it won't fit large plates, pots, or pans. The phone is a cute touch, and my son loves to talk on it as he plays.  The doors are a bit hard to open for a tiny guy like mine, but he gets them open with some effort.\n\nAll in all, I would suggest this kitchen over most others I've seen, but I'd suggest you pay someone else for the assembly (or have at least two movies to watch while you do it).

It's a cheap toy!\n\nIt goes through a lot of soap and we used up the little bottle of bubbles it came with in the first 2 1/2 baths. But then, we're using it a lot, so that's ok.

I'm sure a little bit of dish soap and water would be fine, but the dish soap I have is almond extract soap and it didn't work.\n\nAs for the water-proofing everyone is complaining about, mine seems to be submersible! While we tried the almond dish soap in various ratios with water, I rinsed it out really well between experiments, totally putting it under the faucet. It didn't even occur to me to be careful about the battery compartment. But it's doing just fine! However, I wouldn't go throwing it into the tub and I'll be more careful in the future. But maybe some people just didn't have it closed tightly or something. Or maybe they're making them with a better seal now.

I'm pleased to see that so far the suction cup has held up to their frequent slamming.\n\nBottom line is, it's not a high-end toy.

The recommended age ranges vary, with Amazon saying 6 to 15 years old, and the manufacturer saying it's recommended for ages 6 and up. Unless you have a very patient younger child, I'd say ages 10-13 would be the range that would enjoy this set the most.

My daughter was asking for it to be assembled every hour she was awake until it was assembled.  Knowing it would take awhile, my husband assembled it on the weekend before she got up in the morning.  It took about 45 minutes.\n\nAs fun as this set is, be sure you have the room as this garage takes up even more than the garage itself.  If you connect it to other sets with the tracks as well as the track included...you're not even including the space needed for the car to spin off the track.  That said, it is something to set up and leave where you build it.  Most homes probably will not have the dedicated room to give this toy justice inside but maybe outside on a porch if not inside.\n\nAssembly depends on both complete parts and how well you read the instructions.  My husband thought the levels were all the same and didn't see them already labeled as a color.  Hence the parking space colored numbers don't match the floor color but it still works.  It would have been nice to see the parking numbers already attached to avoid that error.  The other problem we encountered was a grey part that holds down the orange slide to the green tower was missing.  This slows the car down the ramp some so it doesn't usually get enough speed to get past the shark.\n\nMy daughter spent most of the first day it was assembled playing with this toy.  It simply has so many parts that she was always trying something new and enjoyed pushing the buttons.  You will need 3 aa batteries as they do not come with the toy.  I do wish the sound came with a volume control beyond simply on or off.  It simply is a loud toy that can be heard from one end of the house to the other and one of the sounds is a fire siren.\n\nOverall, if your child...or even adult loves hot wheels...you have a family toy for many hours of play.  Hopefully your toy will come with all parts and be sure you read the assembly instructions carefully...my husband tried to skip a few which is why our level colors don't match.", "summary": "A toy to keep you busy for hours", "unixReviewTime": 1440806400}

I brought it to a game Meetup. The idea is to try to match other players answers to the matching topics. Each player gets a different color paddle to write their answers on. There were four of us playing. The first topic was OLD BOOK. We all said The Bible and scored.\n\nIt's an easy game to play, but it can take a while to match an answer. I played two games of it and won both. In addition to writing an answer, the special die has two special spots. One has you teaming up with another player to come up with one answer between you, and another spot has you drawing your answer instead of writing it. We all matched on Superman when we drew an EARLY SUPERHERO.\n\nThe most common answer said scores one point for all who said it. If two answers tie, both answers score. It takes eight matching answers to win. A fun game and up to six can play. The one drawback is the markers which can dry up or wear out easily. I bought matching color markers at a stationery store that work better. I use these same markers for Wits and Wagers, Say Anything and Truth Be Told.

(Note: you may have to purchase borax, cabbage, white glue, and a few other relatively common ingredients to make some of the recipes.)\n\nPROS:\n-It is relatively easy to set up and doesn't have many small parts that could get lost.\n-The instruction booklet is colorful and the recipes are straightforward and (mostly) simple.\n-The pieces of the kit aren't flimsy; they don't feel like they will break (though the dome is thin plastic so one has to be careful).\n-My kids enjoyed it because it was \"hands on\" - they could get \"dirty\" and learn about the slime from experience.\n\nCONS:\n-The vibrator/machine is super noisy.  We had to talk loudly to hear over it; it annoyed other people in the room.\n-The spoon for measuring makes a mess because it has two compartments in the one side - and the two compartments are almost bigger than the bowl used for mixing.\n-Though the booklet is colorful and the recipes are easy to follow, some of the other details and notes in it are not always easy to follow (some of the comments in the booklet are pretty scientific - like those of polymers and cohesion).\n\nTo summarize, this is a neat kit although I wasn't \"blown away\" by it.  If your kids are not too interested in things like this, it might not capture their attention for long.  However, if you have kids who are interested in basic chemistry or making things like this, I'm guessing they'd like it.  And, as with other science kits like this, it does make a mess!

The material puckers in several places along the hem where fabric wasn't laid flat and had gathered on the skirt and there are a couple of places where uneven stitching made with a thick white thread is visible. The seam up her back is rough and puckered as well. It looks as though perhaps the doll was hand stitched in places to repair defects made in the manufacturing process. The doll I received also has a hole in the back where a seam was missed behind the cape and stuffing was coming out of this hole (I will be attaching photos to show these defects). I'm no sewing expert but I plan to pull seams and hems and attempt to do a little repair work but this shouldn't even be a consideration with a doll at this price point.

But most children have had access to these products in friends, family and school to know the difference.\n\nThe apps for LeapPad are more expensive then in the name brand app stores.  Some of the aps for LeapPad were as high as $35.  what if your child doesn't like the game, you are out $35!  There are some features on this product he will probably use and play with, but I don't see it taking the place of his other tablet or game systems.\n\nThe two games taht came with the platinum package was also - in his words - girl games.  another thing to consider - unless they know their demographic is young girls.\n\nBottom line, I think it is well made, just maybe for younger kids and if they don't have access to other brand tablets.", "summary": "Just OK", "unixReviewTime": 1441065600}

As adults we thought this was a great toy, and our older kids got a real kick out of it.  My 1 year old was not so enthusiastic about it.  He watched it and seemed slightly entertained, but couldn't use the toy on his own.  We had to sit with him and put the balls in and chase them when he knocked them out.  He didn't pay much attention to it for several months.  Now he is about 18 months old and is much more interested.  He can put the balls in on his own, and chase and bring them back when they roll away (which only happens when he sticks his hand in the way or tilts the toy.  Otherwise, the balls always loop back through the toy perfectly).  He also likes to turn it on its side and stick his hand in the hole that pops the balls out.  It stops the motor from turning, then he pulls his hand out and watches it start back up.  We have not had any trouble with the motor as some others have.  After six months and some rough treatment, it still works fine.

You can keep any number of them that you want, and you can re-roll the other dice up to two more times.  Based on those dice, you can do a few things - with claws, you attack whichever monster is in Tokyo (or, if you are in Tokyo, you attack everyone else), with hearts, you heal damage (unless you're in Tokyo), if you get three matching numbers, you score that many victory points, and if you roll lightning bolts, you gain energy.  Whenever you attack someone in Tokyo, they must decide if they are staying in Tokyo, or leaving.  If they leave, then you are forced to take over Tokyo - which gives you one point, while making you a target.  But, for each of your turns that you are still in Tokyo, you gain two points.  At the end of each turn, you may also use your accumulated energy to buy upgrades.  The first person to score twenty points wins.

A set of six cards are played which will give you directions on how you are to build your tower of spheres.  You earn points by meeting the different objectives, using each sphere color in your final tower and by the number of spheres that were used.  Fail to meet any of the objectives on the card and you lose points.  All of this occurs in this fast paced game as an hourglass timer counts down the time.\n\nBox Contents:  Top notch quality is found here.  From the 60 heavy plastic spheres to the stands that hold the spheres that you build upon.  You also have multiple cardboard tokens which allow you to keep track of your score.  The box insert holds everything nicely and baggies are included, which is a must to keep the spheres in their place.  It also has compartments designed specifically for the hourglass timer and the cards.\n\nClarity of Rules: The rules are on a large four page color manual that does an excellent job at explaining the rules and provides detailed explanations on each card that may come into play.\n\nGame Play:  To begin play, all players place their spheres on their playing area.  Six cards are then drawn from the deck.  These cards provide the directions on how to play the spheres to meet the rounds objectives.  There are seven types of cards that you will see throughout the game.  1.  Being able to use only a certain number of spheres of a specific color. 2.  Spheres of certain colors must touch somewhere in your tower. 3.  Spheres of certain colors must not touch in your tower.  4.  Spheres of certain colors can not be played above any other spheres .  5.  Spheres of certain colors can not be played below any other spheres.  6. You must have more spheres of one color than another color in your tower.  7.  You must have a combined total of four spheres between two of the colors.  To begin, you simply flip over the hourglass timer, which gives you approximately one minute to complete your tower based on the cards that were played.  Once the timer ends, you add up your points for that round.  Initially, you get a point for every sphere you used.  The top score here is 11, which signifies a full tower.  However, you may not always get this based on the cards that came into play.  You next go through the cards that were played.  If you succeeded, you do not earn any points.  If you failed to meet that objective, you lose two points.  If you met all of the card objectives and you used each sphere color, you earn a bonus token.  The number of bonus tokens you earn will count towards your final score after all rounds are played. The bonuses can vary from -6 to 6 points.  You repeat this for a total of six rounds before the winner is determined.\n\nReplay Ability:  There is plenty of replay ability here until you master this game, which is very possible.  Our oldest son has already gotten to that point where he maximize his points for each round/game.  Once that happens, the intrigue of the game becomes less and less.\n\nAppropriate Audience: 8+ is appropriate.  However,  you could probably go a little younger since your game play is based on how the spheres are to be played and the fact that there is not any text on the cards.  You just need to ensure they won't get frustrated with not meeting the different criteria that may come up from the cards since you lose points for failing.\n\nWhat We Liked/Didn't Like: This is a great family game and really makes everyone think and act quickly.  As a parent, it is fun to watch the kids quickly solve these puzzles.  It is a little frustrating when cards come up that contradict themselves.  However, the directions do address this by telling you that the player can decide which one to use and then take the negative points on the other, which is how we play.  The other options provided in the rules manual allow you to draw a new card and to place the contradicting card back into the deck or to remove certain types of cards up front.  This seems to be a flaw of the game and you shouldn't have to remove cards from the game to make it work for all situations.", "summary": "Dimension Review by TheDiceHaveIt.com", "unixReviewTime": 1463443200}

Beitler", "reviewText": "Over the past two years, I have really become quite the gamer. I now purchase about ten games a year and I am always looking to try out something new. I try to pick up any new games that I can to give them a spin, and this game looked to be quite a bit different from other games I currently own. Most of my games are strategy games, hidden role games, card drafting games, miniatures games, or assorted types of party games. I have very few spatial orienting or dexterity games, so this was truly something new for me to try. So, after a couple of plays, here are my thoughts:\n\n1. Components: Quality is high. The plastic balls have a nice heft to them and are surely sturdy enough to stand up to many plays and falls. All of the cardboard components are plenty thick and were cleanly cut so it was easy to punch out the pieces of each. The cards are printed on a high-quality stock of paper. Instructions are clear, illustrated, and free of errors. My very slight complaint about the components is this: I wish there were a few more small plastic baggies included in the box so that I could sort the many small cardboard components and store them all separate from one another. I happened to have a few small plastic zip-lock bags left over from another game so I was still able to sort them as I wished, but it would have been nice to have a few of these included.\n\n2. Mechanics: This game features some interesting mechanics. The game is all about proper positioning of the colored balls: which color is touching which, how many you can use, where things must go or where they can't go. All of this takes place under the impetus of time, too. This game has little to do with strategy or deduction, yet it is very analytical in nature. There is always a best way to accomplish your tasks, but figuring out what that way is under a short time constraint makes the game more fun (or more frustrating - depending on how your brain works). The game is very easy to learn, yet can be difficult to master.\n\n3. Fun: I found this game to be entertaining, yet it isn't one I am likely to pull out very often. My son liked it pretty well, but the other three members of my family didn't care for it. They found it too difficult and pretty much resigned themselves to losing the game every time they play it. They did not find it fun and will not want to play it again anytime soon. Because of this, I had to give it a lower rating. Though it could still be categorized as a family game, I kind of think you'd have a hard time finding too many households where everyone would like it. This game definitely appeals to certain types of people, and - unfortunately - most of the members of my family are not that type of family. Since two of us thought it was OK and three of us didn't like it, this one may not stay in my collection for long.", "summary": "A very original game that will probably mostly appeal to a niche audience rather than receive widespread appeal...", "unixReviewTime": 1440288000}

The seat tilts forward, and the wheels and steering wheel turn responsively.\n\nMy only complaint, and I've had this issue with both of the ones we've owned (I returned the first one), is with the cart. The cart tilts backward, and it's actually possible without using a lot of force to invert the rod that connects to the hitch on the mower so it swings 180 degrees. It's not meant to go that far, but with the way it's constructed, it can do so with minimal force. With the first one we owned. the rod broke off from the cart completely rendering the cart unusable. With the second one, the rod has been inverted already and a piece of metal at the end of the rod is warped (where it connects to the cart's bed), but it hasn't broken off yet. It's only a matter of time until it does. To avoid this, I have a rule for my son to be very gentle with the cart and not tilt it. It's frustrating that cart was meant to tilt, but if you do, it can break.\n\nI'd be happier if this item was a little cheaper and included the mower only.

I will instead focus on the simplicity and fun portion! I purchased this for my 15 year old son. He had his laptop out and watched all the videos on their website.  He assembled it by himself and it was perfect.  (You might want to start charging the battery first!!  Waiting the hour seemed like forever! )\n\n  Prior to this, he has only flown the Hubsan H107C.  I know that the Hubsan gave him a foundation for flying and the basic skills before he took to the sky with the DJI!  We upgraded because he really wanted to use his GoPro.\n\n  His first flight was flawless - it took a couple minutes for the controller and drone to recognize each other, but that was a short wait.  He kept it low and close until he got the hang of the controller.  Can I insert a WOW right here? WOW.  He hit the \"Return to Home\" (RTH) button and you could see the drone stop, think and return.....hover overhead and then slowly begin coming down.\n\n  Hints and tips for a 1st time user:  Definitely WATCH the videos and read the advice of others in these reviews. You will learn something for sure!  Buy an extra battery and extra props! It does come with extra props, but I have a feeling we will need more!\n\n  We absolutely LOVE the DJI Phantom and look forward to owning  future releases down the road!", "summary": "Easy enough for a 15 year old to assemble and fly - 1 - 2 - 3 !", "unixReviewTime": 1428969600}

I have two other families of grandchildren for whom they were birthday gifts also.  The families use them when going to the park or to the farmer's market.  One family has used it in the local community children's parade for two years running.  The wagon is constructed of sturdy plastic with rounded corners that are unlikely to cause serious bumps for little ones or damage to furniture or the interior of the car when they are loaded up.  They roll well on pavement, gravel, and grass. The canopy comes off easily, but is nice for sun protection when needed. Two children can easily ride on the seats, probably up to about 6 or 7 years old.  They have handy cup holders and are easy to hose off if they get sticky or dirty.  My family members have been very pleased with this product.  I'll probably be getting another in a year or two for my other son's family.  Buying from Amazon is the best way to get this product.

WITH the iPad it is not a lot better.  FIrst, you can download the app and use the drawing feature for free without the iCanvas.  If you have the iCanvas you can use the stylus pen or add one of the six shapes that you see in the pictures (the shapes around the outside of the iCanvas board).  You can use your fingers to adjust the size of the shape just like any iPad/iPhone/iPod drawing app. There are also two games you can use within the iCanvas App, a Memory-matching & a game where you toss a ball to a dog (it makes no sense).  The two games will not work without the iPad plugged in.\n\nI don't think this is at all worth it.  My daughter stopped using the pen and used her finger to draw or color within the app.  She continued to use it even after I popped the iPad out.  My iPad has a few versions of memory that she prefers those over the one that came within the iCanvas app.  Neither of us figured out the dog-ball-toss game.\n\n*Other notes:  When you try to go to the \"photo roll\" within the app, it crashes.  This has happened EVERY time.  It WILL save pictures to the iPad Photos app but you cannot access them from the iCanvas app like it says is possible ( you are suppose to be able to draw on existing pics).

Gibson", "reviewText": "I just received this today... haven't had a chance to actually try it. However this is my fifth tube trainer and third brand of this style of tube trainer that I have purchased in the last year. I have two little ones a year and a half apart, and have used them for both. The first brand I tried was the Swim Tee Trainer.  The second was an Aqua Coach tube trainer.  The reason we keep buying new ones is that we LOVE this style of flotation device, but they keep popping on us from being left in a hot car, or wearing out because of poor design. Last summer my 12 month old could swim around the pool after the second day of swimming with it, and loved it!  They just have to learn how to balance themselves.\n\nThe swim Tee trainer had really flimsy material around the tube that got holes in in from just touching things, like the slides at the pool. This happened with both of our tubes. The rubber inner tube, which you would fill  with an air compressor, eventually was bulging horribly out on all sides.  And that was only after less than a month.  On one of our tubes, a hole in the fabric started from just filling the tube up with air.  This brand really didn't last long.  I think a better material would have made a huge difference.\n\nThe Aqua Coach tube trainer seemed a lot better, but the tube itself was actually smaller, so it was harder to get on my 3 year old.  We could do it, though, and it really wasn't an issue for us.  However, the safety strap wasn't comfortable long enough for my 3 year old to use.  So, we cut the under strap off, and because the tube was too small to fit over his shoulders, I didn't see any reason to worry about the possibility of him falling through.  This one again had the rubber inner tube filled the same way with an air compressor. I was over-all completely satisfied with this brand. I did have one of these pop while being filled up, and therefore, needed one more.  I wasn't particularly careful to get this exact brand - just careful not to get the swim tee trainer - and ended up now with the Aqua Leisure one.\n\nI ordered this Aqua Leisure tube simply because the price was right and I figured it would be worth a try.  I did like that the strap for the bottom had a clip.  On the past ones I had used, they had Velcro to secure the strap, which I was a little worried would perhaps catch on their swimsuits, though they never did.  I thought it might be nice to try this one with a clip and see if I liked it better.  And I figured I might just cut it off again anyway.  Well, just out of the box, my biggest surprise is that this tube is not a durable rubber inner tube.  Through the fabric, it feels like a plastic inner tube that you buy for a couple dollars at the store. The box claims it is a \"rugged inner tube for years of use.\"  You are not supposed to fill this one with an air compressor.  There are TWO little valves that look like the ones on a beach ball or any other blow up toy.  Strange.  I used my bicycle hand pump to fill it up.  I wasn't sure what to expect... I wasn't sure how it would look round like a tire if there were two air compartments.  Since you can't see the inner tube within the fabric, I was really skeptical.  However, once both compartments were filled, it does look fine.  I'm just not sure there is enough air inside to safely hold my little ones up out of the water the way our other ones do.  I will have to give a follow-up once we give this new one a try.\n\nUpdate after first use:\n\nThe tube is not durable.  It popped after about an hour of normal use by a three year old.  It was a slow leak, and very dangerous since it took us a little bit of time for us to realize what had happened.  He was securely above the surface of the water when we began.  Because of the slow leak, it wasn't immediately obvious there was a problem.  At some point, we noticed he was lower in the water, to a nearly dangerous level, and realized there wasn't enough air anymore in the tube.  Of course we were in the water there with him so he was safe, but had we not been paying close attention, it could have meant him drowning.  We immediately took him out of the water, and tried to refill it with the hand pump.  As I put air in, I could hear air leaking out of the tube somewhere, though I couldn't see where because the tube is covered with fabric.  I am so disappointed in the quality of this tube. I am hoping to get my money back.  I am not familiar with Amazon's returning of a product that has been used, and unfortunately I through the box away prematurely.  The box said \"durable\"... I should have trusted my gut instinct and returned it before using.  Any one have suggestions of how I proceed to get my money back??", "summary": "First Impressions", "unixReviewTime": 1369958400}

If I don't fork over my phone it's gonna be a full-blown Calgon moment. My husband is an engineer and I keep telling him to design this toy and make us rich but he's far too busy cleaning baby slobber out of his own phone to worry about my get-rich-quick toy ideas.

Occasionally, when the board gets very crowded, it was difficult to easily see these broken wall areas with the flat cardboard tokens you get in with the bosses pack.

This is important because in some scenarios, you are looking for a green or blue \"X\" on the flip side of the token (which are randomized and placed before the game begins).  These hidden green or blue X's represent finding a key or completing some kind of goal.\nBut if you can tell by looking at the red \"X\" side that it has green or blue on the other side due to a slight inconsistency in the color, it's not right.\n\nWhat I do is I just play the game and not pay attention to the slight differences in red color shade.

The rest of the kit is sturdy but there.\n- You need to panel line and paint parts of this kit to make it anywhere being appealing to the show's version. Many of the parts as you assemble are mostly one colored and the parts that are suppose to be another, you would have to paint it.\n- Drei looks very out of place without her brothers, Zwei and Eins. IMO, you would need all of them to really bring out their presence.\n- For a HG and the content (lack of, really), I wouldn't pay even more than $16. I took on this as $28.08, almost $30.\n\nSo my verdict; if you plan on assembling the trio and maybe Arche Throne, then sure. Just be ready to paint Drei and probably the rest of them if they do come out like Drei did in its kit. If you're just grabbing Drei just because, then no. Frankly, there are better kits to go and grab at the same price or even cheaper or (more expensive in cases like Kshatriya). I was a bit generous of giving Drei three stars but the kit is just underwhelming. Spend that $30+ (quote of contemporary price of $28.77 right now) on some other kit you've had your eyes on.

The Dinobots for Transformers 4 are a bit of a mixed bag. While Slug isn't the top of the heap, there is a lot to like about this Triceratops. The first big thing that old school fans will recognize are the red and purple plates that make up much of Slugs dino form. Each of the new dinobots has its own primary color in the new toyline, from slug to scorn to Snarl. Youll also notice the design choice where Slugs body is much more segmented, in contrast to his G1 likeness. It really pops around his head crest.\n\nIn robot mode, Slug is a part of this knight aesthetic that flows from Optimus on down through many of the supporting characters. The dino head splits to become two massive shoulder parts and is even attached with a screw where the eye would be in dino mode, which is a fun choice. I will say Im not overly crazy about the way his tail dangles off the back of the robot mode, but its not horrible. Hes got some nice articulation and looks really slick standing next to both Scorn and Grimlock. If you can pick him up for under twenty dollars, hes an easy add. Much more than that, and Id be inclined to look at some of the other TF4 toys first.", "summary": "A Dino by any other name...", "unixReviewTime": 1401235200}
