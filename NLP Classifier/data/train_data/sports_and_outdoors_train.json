It's very convenient and I KNOW this little machine will be put to use quite frequently so I'm hoping it keeps up with the demand. I'll do another update later if I find anything significant more to share about the machine. I really like this little thing tho.

Let me tell you...it does not disappoint and gave me exactly what I wanted!\n\nHere are the specs:\n#1) VG-10 blade steel\n\n#2) Foliage Green FRN (Fiberglass Reinforced Nylon) handles with Spyderco's Volcano Grip which offers excellent slip resistance and feel\n\n#3) Open length of: 4.375\" inches or 111mm...Length closed is 2.438\" inches or 62mm...Blade thickness is: 0.78\" inches or 2mm...Blade length is: 1.938\" or 49mm...Cutting edge is: 1.687\" inches or 43mm...and the weight of this knife is a beautiful: .06 oz or 18g.....*Please Note* (These specs are taken directly from Spyderco's website itself, so they are accurate and true)\n\n#4) Adjustable Torx pivot screw for blade retention adjustments\n\n#5) Torx screw in handle for blade removal or cleaning\n\nPros:\n Arrived shaving sharp\nVG-10 steel\nExcellent Grip\nExtremely lightweight (I'm carrying it in my pocket as I write this!)\nConceals very well\nSmooth opening\nplain edge knife\n\nThe Spyderhole IS usable despite it's small size\n\nWonderful color: It is a foliage green that is used in the U.S. Army's camo design and it actually does \"shade shift\" as Spyderco proclaims...against a gray background the knife seems to shift to a gray color, but against a darker green background it appears to turn a dark earthy foliage green.\n\nSolid lockback lockup\n\nLanyard hole for paracord or any other lanyards!\n\nAddjustable Torx screws for the blade retention and removal and or cleaning applications! HUGE PLUS!!! That is one of the big reasons I bought it! It's so little and still adjustable to your liking!\n\nCons:\nI personally have none for the knife, however these are something's to keep in mind that others have mentioned:\n\n#1) I have medium sized hands and if you have larger hands it may be difficult to get a good grip on to open it as it is small, but it's not impossible, it may just take some getting use to.\n\n#2) The SpyderHole is small. It IS fully functional and can be open one-handed....however with bigger or gloved hands, it may take some getting use to as well.\n\n#3) No pocket clip: This may be an issue to some, as you cannot clip it to you pants or a pocket, but I find it to be for the better. I like to slip this knife in the coin pocket in my jeans and it's not even noticeable, or when I go to the gym, it slips effortlessly into some loose shorts; It only has a lanyard hole as mentioned earlier. (***If you want a small knife such as this one WITH a pocket clip check out the Spyderco Dragonfly***)\n\n#4) It is a lockback blade, so anybody living in a restricted area or under specific regulations such as the UK may have to check with local laws. However, Spyderco makes wonderful choices for UK or restricted knife law areas residents, such as the UK Penknife or any of the \"Bug\" series knives.\n\n#4) Not made in the U.S.A.: This may bother some folks as some people like to buy \"American only\" made items. The Ladybug is made in Seki-City Japan and has fantastic quality control backing it...I mean hey, Spyderco's founder Sal Glesser carries one...it's got to be good!\n\n#5) Some have mentioned that the name \"LadyBug\" is an embarrassing title to carry around with you....if it is a problem then Spyderco also makes the \"ManBug\", however I think this statement is just silly, it's a tool and hey if it works good, what does the name have to do with anything??? But it may rise some issues with some folks.\n\nAll in all I personally think Spyderco hit the nail on the head with this knife. It's small sure!, but don't let it deter you. You have to use it within it's limits. It is a small knife with big cutting power, but trying to split logs or cut thru mooring lines probably won't work to well.\nIt's an invaluable tool I carry on me everyday and I find at least 1 use for it everyday! Pair it with a small Streamlight Microstream, a Zippo, and a small multi tool, and you have a beautiful EDC setup!\n Whether it be cleaning your fingernails, to cutting a pesky loose string off your clothes, or to opening a package, this little Ladybug has you covered! I fully recommend picking one up if you need a lightweight, razor sharp, go anywhere knife that won't let you down and gives you more capabilities than one could think! Put it on a lanyard, toss it in a pocket, put it on a chain and wear it, or put it on a keyring, nobody should leave home without a LadyBug on their person!\n\nI would also like to tell Amazon thank you for always getting my orders correct and on the time expected! I have been doing business with Amazon for years and I will certainly continue to do so. Excellent customer service, shipping, and prices! Keep up the good work!\n~Christian~\nI apologize for the lengthy review I just wanted to help somebody make a well informed decision before they purchase something!

The issue with any tool like this is that it can hurt your shoulders, and your knees, but I'm not sure there is a way around that (with this type of exercise).

I was unsure 60L would be enough space and was tempted to go bigger, but for a 2-3 backpacking trip like I did, it was just right.  I think it would have been fine for about a week trip actually.  I did have to buy a compression sack to fit my sleeping back in the bottom of the bag, but I'm sure that's standard for any internal frame bag.  The only thing that I would say could be better for a skinny guy like myself is the hip padding.  My brother in law has a very similar osprey bag with the same padding setup, and didn't have any soreness, but I am skinnier and was pretty bruised up on my hips after carrying around 35-40 lbs for 20 miles.  I have another osprey backpack (a very high end child carrier, can't remember the name-too lazy to look it up) and I had the same problem, and I really think its a skinny person problem that would happen with most any backpacking bag.

I've had it for several months and used it many times. I prefer to buy American, and this is better than the imports I'm familiar with. It's a solid steel square tubing frame with steel bolts going through threaded plastic parts (metal would be better but I haven't had any problems), and the end caps for the tubes are plastic, which are holding up fine. One of the plastic threaded parts was missing on arrival, but CTK immediately sent me another one out at no charge. The carpet on the buttpad was a bit crooked and unevenly cut, which was poor quality control. The glue on the padding under the carpet is not great, so it worked itself loose after some use. I trimmed it and re-glued it, and no problems since. Same with the Y front carpet. There's no rear strap or backstop for recoil, but the upside to that is you can get a good shoulder purchase on your rifle, which I like. I just want something hold it still while I zero, and this works better for me and is more convenient than a front bipod and rear bag or plain sandbags. I would like to see a square flat front rest with a bag that adjusts to width made available as an option. The Y is versatile and accommodates all my rifles from traditional stocks to big quad rail assault rifles, and also works well as a pistol and revolver rest. Instructions consist of only a parts diagram, which I was able to decipher pretty easily. It's a good rest but I was expecting perfect fit/finish/quality from the reviews. I subtracted one star for the QC issues of the missing part and carpet cut/glue. Even though I have nit-picked over some suggestions for CTK, it is a very good rest for the price. It's better than anything in this price range and even competing products costing up to twice as much, which are all made in communist China. If you're like me and don't have a grand or more to spend on a really high end American rest, buy this one, it's the best you'll get for the money and is overall a solid American product.", "summary": "Decent product, American made", "unixReviewTime": 1371081600}

The electronics are as advertised.\n\nI will give this bike a good workout and hopefully get back and ad to this review.\n\nConcerns:  The transmitter for speed could be a little vulnerable and looks delicate.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI have been on this bike for about six weeks.  I really love it.  It is solid, stable, smooth and silent.  I use chrome cast on my laptop to transmit Spin VIdeo's to my widescreen TV.  There are some really good videos available.

PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS! I cant believe out of all the crazy regulations that this country has and is talking about implementing that this company is able to sell this device. God forbid anyone from buying this Caliper Release.

I recently purchased 2 of the 150 Lumen Tactical lights with rail and those are perfect size for my Mossberg 590 Shockwave + 16\" barrel ultra light AR-15 with collapsible stock. Ordered one of these Ultra Compacts and yes, this thing is tiny. Takes one battery where the 150 Tactical takes 2 batteries. Amazing thing is when compared to the 150 Tactical, this tiny ultra actually has a whiter spot beam and puts out a higher level of light than the 150 Tactical (which has a duller spot pattern. Must be the design diff in front lens area. Mounted the ultra on my Shockwave but it is a little to small, not as easy to reach as it's Big Brother the 150 Tactical. However, it is definitely brighter and a richer spot beam, which would go on the subject for home defense. What a dilemma I'm in!!! Both are amazing lights for the money!! Great material, just go slow and easy with the mounting screws. I am very careful with installs and the head on the screw which holds the ultra onto the mount stripped although I had the supplied allen wrench bottomed out. I think it was slightly smaller when made. Will call Monstrum and with their excellent customer service, I know they will ship me a replacement screw. This little light is so compact that I am purchasing a 2nd one to keep in my truck. Not sure about the battery life or if it will withstand a 12GA shot. It does state rifles and shotguns but common sense tells me for the price, most likely would crack the led bulb or ruin tailcap. Only improvement on this Ultra would be a larger tailcap button. A little small for my larger fingers but it still works. Bonus is the included pressure switch and cap if you are into those options.

As listed in the description, you get the following:\n\n1 Light + Mount\n1 TailLight\n2 18650 batteries (My favorite battery type)\n4 CR2032 batteries (think watch batteries)\n1 18650 charger + 18\" charge cable (microUSB)\n1 AAA insertion pack (Replacement for those who prefer AAA over 18650)\n\nSo the package that you're getting for the cost, is immensely impressive.  I'm giving it 4 stars for a couple of reasons, none of which qualify the light or package as sub-par, simply noting a few issues that other lights improve upon, though often at a price hike.\n\nAlso note: I used Orbtronic 3100mA 18650's over the batteries provided by Sunspeed.  They are the best 18650's I've found and come with protected circuits, which are highly recommended on batteries that store as much power as 18650's do.  Anyway, on to the nit-picking\n\nGood Points:\nFocused beam - the main light can be rotated at the head to focus the light down to a 3' circle at 40' away -- and then broadened out to a less bright, but wider beam for road riding.\nRechargeable batteries - Including 18650 batteries with the set is pretty awesome\n3 Settings - A high beam, low beam, and strobe function\nTail Light - Bright and visible, can also be set to solid or strobe function\nEasy Mounting - Mounts to your bike via a C clamp that closes to form a full O.  The included tightening screw has a large enough surface and grooves that make it easy to finger tighten\n\nSlight Issues:\nBrightness - the beam from this light has a slight blue haze to it, which isn't bad, but it detracts from the total brightness.  In comparison tests, it was far less luminescent than it's competitors (See pictures).\nUnknown Battery Maker - As mentioned earlier, 18650's have the potential to start major fires if they are not monitored during charging.  Even with smart chargers, batteries that do not have internal protection circuits have a small potential to overheat and start a fire.  While the batteries are nice, if you can't charge them outside, it's recommended to invest in some reputable batteries or transition to the less powerful AAA variant.\n\nBut all in all, this is a great bike set.  I have it installed on a Schwinn hybrid bike I bought 4 or 5 years ago and I thoroughly appreciate the usefulness it provides at night.\n\nGuess what - I got this light in exchange for a review, I like to think I'm honest and fair.  If you don't agree, please let me know\n\nTest Lights Listed Below:\nSunSpeed Light\nTaoTronics ThorLite (quoted lumen rating - 500)\nCygoLite Expilion (quoted lumen rating - 850)\nSerfas TSL-S500 (quoted lumen rating - 500)\nBoruit RJ-5000 (quoted lumen rating - 5000 LOL)", "summary": "Don't become roadkill - Get a bike light", "unixReviewTime": 1447372800}

It wasn't the cheapest one, but I'm glad that I bought it.  I had it set up and my Trek Verve 2 installed in 30 minutes.  I didn't need to change out the axle, because my stock one fit perfectly into the coned cups.\n\nA little background here.  The last time I rode was in 1964, so I'm out of the biking loop.  I made a lot of progress in a couple of months, and don't want to lose my gains over the Ohio winter.  Based on many reviews here, I got the Kurt.\n\nIt was easy to set up, and is very sturdy, and does not rock around when pedaling.  Many people had noise issues with their tires, but mine are surprisingly quiet.  I barely have to turn up the volume while watching a movie.  What I hear is a whirling noise and it is not annoying at all me.  I bought the front wheel riser block to keep the bike level.\n\nI did order a tire in anticipation of noise, but it will not be used until the stock tire dies.  This tire can be used for normal road use too, so it won't go to waste.  My tire size is 700 x 35.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Schwalbe-Kojak-Folding-Bead-Tire/dp/B004YIBJ90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Schwalbe Kojak Folding Bead Tire</a>\n\nAlso, others have complained of rubber coming off their tires.  I've got an hour and a half on mine and there is no rubber on the spool or clean basement floor.  My spool  is exactly at 90 degrees to the wheel.  This would be something to check for those losing rubber.  Perhaps something is skewed.\n\nI'll repost if I have any issues in the future.  Now I need a wireless computer that is strong enough to send a signal to the handle bars.\n[edit]  I've had this unit for about a month, and do 30 minute sessions, 4 times a week.  There is positively no tire shredding or oil leaking,  ... or any drama at all.  It just plain works, and I would buy the same model again if the house burned down.\n\nAs an aside:  I have 3 # dumbbells that I use while pedaling to keep my arms and shoulders in good condition.  It just does not make sense to only use the lower half of your body.  You can buy them anywhere, but here is a link to see what I'm talking about.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SPRI-Deluxe-Vinyl-Dumbbells-Set-of-2/dp/B008DSK9B6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SPRI Deluxe Vinyl Dumbbells (Set of 2)</a>\n\nCheers,  Packrat1947", "summary": "Very pleased with Kurt Trainer", "unixReviewTime": 1387238400}

Way to go, Amazon!\n\nI've upgraded the item's star rating to a five from a four.\n\nThe kukri is great overall - just be aware that it is high carbon steel, and the same qualities that make it easy to sharpen and to keep it's edge, happen to make it susceptible to rust. SO - between uses, keep it oiled, after use, wipe it down and oil it (out in the field I've used oil from my truck's dipstick - I now carry a can of 3 in 1 oil in the truck). After I get the kukri home, I put some kerosene on a ScotchBrite pad and scrub the kukri, removing all vegetative and zombie crud. Then, if needed, I'll give it a \"touch up\" with a fine file, oil it, and put it back in it's sheath.\nThe knife (machete) has good balance in the hand, the metal is heavy and strong enough to handle it's intended task,and the Kraton handle is superb.\n\nAbout the sheath - the sheath could be better quality, there's no doubt. What I found was that the leather is very stiff, and dry. The two little closure straps with snaps have been formed with a sharp (deep) U-shape, and when you want to put the kukri into the sheath, you have to have one hand hold both straps while your other hand places the kukri in the sheath - a pain in the butt. So, I decided to nourish not only those straps but all of the leather, with a generous amount of \"Bick 4 Leather Conditioner\", and I worked the straps back and forth while massaqging them with the Bick'a, to make them more supple and easier to deal with.\n\nBTW - I also have a KA-BAR brand USMC knife, the one with the plain (unserrated) blade and the compressed leather, and I have no intention of actually using it, just because it's so darn purdy and I don't want to mess it up. I keep it just for display - a piece of American history. The KA-BAR folks know how to make great knives (and I have no problem whatsoever with the kurki made in the democratic republic of Taiwan - please don't confuse Chinese crap with Taiwanese-made merchandise, they're worlds apart).", "summary": "Great, BUT- UpDaTeD", "unixReviewTime": 1380672000}

I try to buy \"Made in America\" as much as I can!!!\n\nI have been into airguns for many many years.  I still have and use a 30+ year old Benjamin 342 multi pump.  PCPs are a whole new level.\n\nThe Marauder is relatively powerful, quiet...and can be made quieter with some legal aftermarket products.  Accuracy is excellent, with no need to develop special holds like the \"artillery hold\" that is popular with spring or nitro guns.  Just shoot them like any other \"real\" rifle you have experience with.  Aim small, miss small.  With ammo scarce and expensive, this rifle is good to keep your skills up.  Fundamentals are the same.  Breath control, squeeze, bang...or pop as these things go.\n\n8 round magazine is nice, as my Condor is single shot.  Having a quick follow up shot is nice if you use it for hunting...and this rifle can be used for hunting.  Game as large as coyotes have been taken.  Personally I would not be comfortable taking a coyote, but if my skills were better  and I could be assured of a humane kill I would if I was hunting coyote.  Some folks have the skills and have done so.\n\nNow I haven't shot anything but paper with my rifle.  This is just to inform about the power level of this rifle.  It is not a toy, but an adult air rifle.  Make sure you have a good backstop and be aware of what is behind whatever you are shooting at.  I have read on the forums of guys taking ground squirrels and birds at 100+ yards.\n\nThe barrel is a high quality American product.  I have heard the .177 and .22 barrels are a bit of a hit and miss.  Some are great others not so good.  There are folks making aftermarket barrels for those rifles though if you buy one of those and get a lemon.\n\nI recommend a Hill or FX pump if you are going to hand pump.  It is not hard, just use your legs like doing shallow squats.  I pump mine up during commercial breaks LOL.  Heat is the enemy of pumps, so just take it slow, pause at the top of the stroke as well as the bottom.  With all the valving, you want to make sure each chamber has a chance to fill before pumping.\n\nYou can use any rifle scope you have as well.  Springers or nitro guns need airgun rated scopes as the double recoil will kill even the most expensive rifle scope.  These guns are safe for any scope you have laying around.\n\nI recommend this rifle if you are doing pest control or small game hunting.  It uses more air than a .177 or .22 so if you are just punching holes in paper you might consider another caliber.  You will get more shots per fill on a smaller caliber.", "summary": "Marauder .25", "unixReviewTime": 1411862400}

You don't expect to cut steak with a plastic knife the same as you would with a metal knife, so keep that is mind if you are thinking about buying one of these.\n\nThat said, this is a sharp plastic knife. I wanted to check out Cold Steel's Night Shade series and after watching a few YouTube reviews, along with reading up here on Amazon, I though this one would be the best buy. I was not disappointed.\n\nIt is VERY light. It has a good grip, easy to maneuver in your hand. I easily ripped up the cardboard box it came in, by both piercing and slashing it. The knife stabs very well, and it slashed much better than I thought it would. I am very impressed with this plastic knife and plan to buy more of them.\n\nIt can be easily hidden, without worrying too much about the kids finding it. They can handle the \"blade\" without getting cut. It is great for using as a practice knife too, and it will do more damage that Cold Steel's rubber trainers.\n\nThere were a few cons that took a star away. The first was the metal ring attached. There was not real point to this. It made using the ring on the knife harder to use and was a pain to get off.\n\nThe one I got did have a few dents in it, but not enough to send back. The tip was bent a little, but after cutting up the box, it was back in shape looking great.\n\nIf you are wanting to hang this up as decoration, it looks cheap, in my opinion.\n\nThe grip is as good as you would expect for the price. I will likely put some griping tape on mine.\n\nThe design is great, and I would love to see an all metal version of this knife, but as plastic it is really just good for training and/or easily stashed defensive weapon (as it is advertised to be).", "summary": "Great knife design for a plastic knife", "unixReviewTime": 1327017600}

Both very stylish; the only logos on them are the words \"Solo Stove\" in small letters. The pot and the stove itself each come in a black waterproof travel bags. It's possible for both to be in their separate travel bags, and still put the stove inside the pot for traveling, and that way it doesn't rattle around inside the pot. The stove itself seems very durable. Most of the parts (like the handles) can be taken off, so cleaning is easy and if one breaks, it could be replaced. The cooking ring is very durable - the tabs that hold the pot up are strong enough that I was unable to bend them when I tried. The only instructions that come with the pot are a vague overview of what to do written on the box, so I suggest you read many reviews of how other people use it to get some tips.\n\nHere is how I lit the stove:\nThe first thing I did was collect a pile of twigs and thin branches. Dry wood is a must - the fire will be less smoky, and it will burn more efficiently. Where I live there is about a foot of snow on the ground, and it snows or rains often, so it can sometimes be difficult to find dry wood. I suggest looking for dead branches on trees that are sheltered from rain due to the higher branches. I collected twigs that ranged from the diameter of a match to the diameter of a pencil for about five minutes, creating a fairly decent pile of sticks. Make sure you keep them dry not putting your pile directly on the ground or somewhere where they can get moist.\n\nNext, I assembled my solo stove on a flat rock, and arranged the smallest of my twigs on the wire grate inside the stove. I used a little bit of dryer lint underneath the twigs to act as my tinder, but if you don't have any, then extremely dry, crushed up leaves, a fluffed up piece of grape vine, or birch bark shavings are also great tinder materials. It is also possible to just light the twigs themselves if they are small enough, in which case you don't need tinder. Make sure your pile is accessible and ready to go, broken into pieces a few inches long so that you can add more twigs to feed the fire and keep it going. With one match, I was able to get my fire started and roaring high above the top of the stove in ten seconds. I added more twigs, beginning with the thinner ones, and then adding the thicker ones once the fire became big enough.\n\nOnce the fire was started, I put the cooking ring and my pot of water on the stove. I kept the fire roaring by adding more twigs about every 20 seconds. You may be able to get away with adding them less frequently if you add thicker twigs, or if you don't want the fire to be so high that it's practically engulfing the bottom of the pot. By keeping the fire that high the whole time, I was able to boil 32 oz of water (4 cups) in about seven minutes, and had my Ramen cooked and eaten within 15 minutes of starting to collect twigs. I didn't use all of the twigs in my pile, but it's better to have more than you need than to have to scramble around while you are cooking, trying to find more fuel.\n\nOverall, I was impressed and happy with this stove. Sure, it takes a little more effort than simply turning on a gas camping stove, since you have to feed more twigs into it every so often, but not using bottles of fuel saves space and weight in your pack, and you don't have to worry about running out of fuel, unless you are camping in the desert, frozen tundra, or on the ocean. The fact that the stove fits inside the pot also saves a lot of room, and the pot is a great size for making meals for two or more, so if you don't camp alone, you will want a pot this large anyway.\n\nCleaning the stove and pot was easy. Since I kept my fire big, the bottom of my pot was covered in soot. Most of the soot wiped right off with some water and a paper towel, and almost all of what didn't easily wipe off came off after some scrubbing. The stove changed colors a little and looks a little scorched where the heat touched it the most, but I think it looks better that way. What I was really surprised about was how cool the outside and bottom of the stove stayed, even while the fire was roaring inside. I was able to pick it up and move it, and it was cool enough to touch with bare hands. The pot has handles that pop out that allow you to carry the pot when it's hot - you just have to remember to pop out the handles before the pot gets too hot to touch it.\n\nThe only downsides I found: The day after I got the combo, the travel bag for the pot ripped along the seam. The bag seems like such heavy-duty construction, but the seams are apparently very weak. This is nothing a sewing machine can't fix, but I was surprised that it ripped so soon. It wasn't even under any stress - just ripped from being picked up and moved. I hadn't even used the pot yet. Definitely not a deal breaker - it's still a nice, waterproof bag with a nice drawstring - just the seams are a bit weaker than necessary. The only other downside I have found is how soot builds up on the pot because of the wood fire. However, it's fairly easy to get the soot off with just some paper towels and water, and you can search the Internet for many other tips on removing soot if you need to.\n\nGreat product! I definitely recommend this combo.", "summary": "Solo Stove and Pot Combo - Tips", "unixReviewTime": 1394323200}

There are six components to each snake.  Each comes with a brass weighted tip attached to about 24 of paracord which is then stitched in the barrel snake fabric which is also about 24\" in length.  The fabric thickness and width changes for each caliber.  The other four segments are a cleaner section, a brush section, a drying section and finally an oil section.  You can find numerous videos online to instruct you on the proper techniques and products to use for this process.\n\nConclusion\nI love the simplicity of the barrel snake system and design.  They are relatively inexpensive so you can buy one for each caliber of firearm you have.  I like the fact that you can clean the snakes to keep them in good condition for your next use (recommend placing them in a tight laundry sack for delicates before placing them in the washing machine).  Full disclosure, I love to shop on amazon and I always look at customer reviews and the number of stars for the review total average before purchasing a product. Since I rely heavily on others reviews, I am always honest in my reviews, and try to always leave feedback to help others when making a purchase.

She had never used a casting rod before so I thought that using a left-hand retrieve would be good for her.  That part is fine.  She has used this reel on freshwater only and it has been bathed in reel-magic several times.\n\nHowever, I've not been impressed with the reel.  It worked OK for the first year or so, but over the past 6 months it has progressively gotten worse about not recovering from a cast sequence by turning the handle.  What I mean by this, after you push the button, make the cast, and then start reeling it won't \"click in\" to start turning the spool.\n\nI looked it up on YouTube and learned how to completely take it apart.  I found that the mechanism that holds a particular plate down so it can catch the button retrieve is worn or the arm that does the pushing is worn.  I was able to improve it's ability to work most of the time, but occasionally it still fails to click in to catch the spool.  This is most annoying when fishing top water lures and you can't get the reel to work when a fish is smacking your lure.\n\nOther than that issue, the reel has functioned as advertised.  My wife really likes the magnetic adjustments and has learned how to get the reel to perform quite well for casting (I'm proud of her!).\n\nHowever, I will not be buying another Abu Garcia Black Max. Based on working performance I'd give it a 4 or a 5 but from a mechanical performance it's a 1. I have a Shimano Curado bait caster that has been used on saltwater without proper maintenance that is performing 10 times better and is twice as old.  Of course it cost twice as much too!\n\nAs I said in the title: You get what you pay for.\n\nAdded NOTE:  My wife and I fish more than most. For the first 6 months of this reel's life it was fished with nearly 3 times a week.  Even now it is used about 4 times a month on average. So maybe we used it up faster than Abu Garcia planned?  Still doesn't make me a happy customer.\n\nUPDATE 2/11/15:  The \"fix\" didn't work very well.  It seems to have helped but it still acts up two or three times per fishing trip.  Looks like a new Shimano Curado is on my shopping list.", "summary": "You get what you pay for", "unixReviewTime": 1421193600}

I will make updates if my opinion changes or if my machine has quality issues.\n\nLike many people, I considered the top rowers available (Concept2 and WaterRower) before purchasing this ProRower.  I have used the Concept2 in gyms many times, so I was familiar with that machine.  I had never previously tried any water based rowing machine.  I decided to go with a water machine based on the noise and feel of the Concept2 compared to the many reviewers opinion on water based machines.  I wanted something quieter and more relaxing.\n\nHaving narrowed my search to a water machine, I considered price and ease of movement of the machine.  The WaterRower was significantly more expensive that the ProRower.  In addition, the WaterRower was heavier and larger (we move our rower in front of our TV to use it and store it in a back room when not in use so low weight and size are key).\n\nSo far I'm very happy with my purchase.  I can confirm that I prefer using a water based rower over the air based Concept2.  Its MUCH quieter, and the smoothness really helps me get into a rhythm.  As stated by many reviewers, even with the max water in the tank, the resistance is not as high as what can be achieved with the Concept2.  However, it is more than adequate and provides a decent challenge (I row for 1 hour sessions, without interval training and it is tiring).\n\nThe ProRower arrived in two boxes, approximately 90% assembled.  It was by far the easiest to assemble workout equipment I've bought (compared to 2 ellipticals and a treadmill).  It takes at most 30 easy minutes to assemble and begin rowing.  The machine is very solid in use and gives the impression that it will last a long time.  Certainly the bungee recoil cord appears to be the weak link.  If I have any issues I will post an update.  The display is large and easy to read and suites my purposes by displaying time and strokes, the metrics I prefer for gauging my effort level.\n\nFilled to max water capacity, the machine is somewhat heavier than I was hoping, but still light enough to roll around on carpet and into another room.  It stands up very easily and in that position takes up very little space.\n\nOn the whole, this appears to be a good value for a solid rowing machine and I would recommend it to anyone.", "summary": "Great rower at a good value.", "unixReviewTime": 1329436800}

Various brands and slightly varying styles.\nThis is by far the best one yet.  I will admit I was a little concerned about the large plastic side release buckle, because it's quite honestly the only thing in the picture of the OD version that looked cheap...  Boy was I wrong.  I quickly reminded myself when I opened the packaging that this epic pack wasn't going to be used to hold anything more than a single days worth of gear for casual hikes, scouting or as a grab n' go light weight pack for short road trips.  If the military look is what your looking for and are a student, this could be _the_ pack for your entire stint through school.  No joke, this pack is robust.\nFully ambidextrous, which for me as a Lefty, this was a huge turn on and one of my biggest complaints with previous purchases.\nThe shoulder strap is comfortable and adjustable.  The Handle is strong enough and the general stitching is top notch that if I filled this bag full of bricks and started swingin', I wouldn't have anything to worry about.  ;)  So don't worry about the weight with this bad boy.  If you can fit it inside and the zippers close, your golden.\nThe cross body security strap is adjustable and keeps this pack snug to the body as your traversing obstacles, generally in motion and even felt secure enough under a light jog without feeling out of control or losing anything.  Even under a stressed run, the pack shifted ever so slightly, but was still secure and comfortable.\nDrain holes are a bonus and actually well done.  Located in both main compartments.\nThere are seriously all bases covered on this pack when you sit and seriously consider all the thought that went into each elastic strap, molle points, the blind zippers, key ring strap, etc.\nTotal empty weight is 1.5lbs (680g)\n***\nAs awesome as it is, there are 2 flaws with this pack though.  Both of which are unable to be seen in the advertising pictures.\nThe first one is the choice of plastic clips that is attached to the end of the shoulder strap, which clips to the lower D-rings on either side of the pack.  The hinged design is completely unnecessary and only introduces another failure point in the design.\nEven though it is the same heavy duty injection molded plastic as the D-rings & side release buckles, the single point clip design and sewn strap provides enough flexibility.  The swivel design is failure point enough.\nSecondly, at the very bottom of the pack, where the edge piping is stitched all the way around the pack, where the two ends meet, is the ONLY place on this entire pack that is stitched horribly.\nAs your looking and feeling the pack in your hands... Epppiiicccc, and then, s*** the bed...  Really?  Your going to finish the stitching on these beautiful and durable packs as if a 5 year old operating a sewing machine for the first time wrapped it up?!\nHowever, even with its flaws, I absolutely love this pack.\nIf the applications I've listed above are right up your ally, this is the pack for you.\nHuh?  What?  20 USD??????  Inconceivable...  You couldn't even buy the plastic components and zippers for that price, let alone the rest of the material, let alone this quality assembled sling pack.  Oh wait, you can. ;)", "summary": "Great bag doesn't even cover it...", "unixReviewTime": 1399593600}

I read other reviewers' complaints about this, but figured it would be OK for my Mossberg MMR Hunter with a 20-inch barrel, which measures 38.75 inches.  I was right, my rifle fits, but there is not even a half-inch to spare.  This bag is only 41 inches long on the outside (at the spine), and 39 inches long on the inside.  Even if you measure diagonally from corner to corner (which makes zero sense), it is still only 42 inches.  Bottom line:  IF YOUR RIFLE IS LONGER THAN 39 INCHES, IT WILL NOT FIT.\n\nIf your gun is 39 inches or less, this is a very high quality bag, I believe.  The pockets are fine for AR-15 standard 30-round mags, even with  MagPul rubber magazine assist gizmos.  They are just a bit tight, but that's good, the mags won't slide out on their own.  But the pockets are definitely too tight for an AK.  The sling attaches at the wrong points for comfortable carry, but I don't need it, I use the handles to go the 100 yards from car to range.\n\nI haven't had this case long enough to vouch for its endurance, but it seems well-made, the zippers seem strong, so I believe it will last a good long while.", "summary": "Good case, wrong measurement", "unixReviewTime": 1455321600}

Thanks to Amazon's meticulous record keeping, I now realize I own 6 of these.\n\nLet's be realistic. The purpose of this knife is to be the cheapest possible fixed blade knife. And you know what? This really is just that.\n\"So, what is it?\"\n-It's essentially what's known as a knife \"blank\" with some braided nylon cordage (NOT paracord) wrapped around the grip.\n\n\"Will you need to sharpen it?\"\n-You bet. It's under 10 bucks, so you should expect that.\n\n\"Is the sheath terrible?\"\n-Pretty much. It holds the knife and ferro rod,  but there's no retention and the durability is just \"ok.\"\n\n\"Is that \"serrated\" or \"saw\" spine just aesthetic?\"\n-Sure is. It's not useful for anything. At all. Probably should have been left plain but this is what the designer decided to go with and people are buying it. More power to 'em.\n\n\"How durable is it?\"\n-I'd say \"Surprisingly unbreakable.\" It's a cheap stainless steel, most likely a 440 because that seems to be the cheapest material these days. BUT it's thick enough (about 1/8\") and a simple design. I haven't managed to break one via normal (but by no means gentle) use. And being stainless, it refuses to rust.\n\n\"Will it take/keep a good edge?\"\n-From a knife snob perspective, not really. It won't split atoms, but it's able to get plenty sharp for normal outdoor knife use. I'll usually sharpen it after about 3 or 4 trips out into the woods. Your mileage may vary, but again...this is a knife that you can get for under 10 bucks.\n\n\"What are the dimensions/weight?\"\n-I have yet to put one on a scale or micrometer. If you really want me to, I'll do it (just leave a comment). Overall length is 11\" like the description says. Cutting edge (as you can see) is less than half that due to the finger choil.\n\n\"Is the ferro rod worth it?\"\n-YES! In fact, you can find other \"fire steels\" of this size for about 10 bucks...and they don't come with a knife! The rod is about 1/4\" thick (again, haven't measured) and about 2 inches long. I've worn through almost half of the first one I got (well over a hundred of successful fires) and the plastic end still hasn't broken or popped off.\n\n\"Would you trust it as your only knife?\"\n-Not only would I, I have many times. I keep a couple in emergency kits now, but back in '12 I carried this knife with me on all my overnights in the woods. That thing has chopped a lot of wood - even batoning. It's now been retired, but only because I've long since upgraded. I'd still rely on it in a heartbeat.", "summary": "FAQ Section:", "unixReviewTime": 1446163200}

My brother loved his Big Wheel so much, that my son also had to have one when he was 3. Even though he was too small, he didn't care- walking it was just as good as riding it.\n\nThings haven't changed much in the design, the big wheel bikes are all still too large for children under 4-5, but the quality has changed a lot for the original Big Wheel. After replacing the back seat 3 times, the original current Big Wheel of our nephew's recently went to the garbage. Replacing the Big Wheel with a tricycle was even worse- after a couple turns- the head injuries even with a helmet proved to be going from a cheap big wheel to bruises.\n\nThis Radio Flyer Deluxe Big Flyer is very similar to the Big Wheel of the seventies- very sturdy. The seat doesn't break at the pegs like the current Big Wheel. It is still too large for children under 5, but they don't care- they enjoy just having it, even if they have to walk it. They use their feet anyway for braking, so they don't mind walking it until their feet reach the pedals. My son walked his Big Wheel for a year before he could reach the pedals.\n\nThe best thing about this Radio Flyer Deluxe Big Flyer is our nephews love it. Taking the fastest high speed turns ends up in falls inches from the ground- meaning less painful minor injuries. My brother and son never had a bad injury being so close to the ground and this was in the days of no head protection. Putting it together was not difficult with the directions and once together, it's hard to keep the kids off. It's nice to see Radio Flyer keeping the tradition of making a sturdy Big Flyer that is perfect for 4 to 7 year olds, just like in the seventies when things were built to last.", "summary": "Big Flyer Is Sturdy, Safe & Our Boys Favorite", "unixReviewTime": 1433980800}

These will remove the paint around the rim and may scratch the bottle but it fits in just fine with all of the scratches and dents that show that this a well loved bottle. I also had to adjust this cap in the same way as the other. This cap also was offset a bit to the rear. I increased the angle of the hinge where it comes off of the cap a wee bit and it is now centered.

It is a smooth knife, but it's also a bit stiff at the pivot. I did carry it for 2 days and flicked it open/closed a lot in order to break it in for him. The 3 stars is because I was flipping it open all night breaking it in and the metal filings were coming out from where the pivot is, that is perfectly fine with me because that means it's breaking in and smoothing out, but the orange just seems to absorb the filings and now it looks dirty on the G10 at the thumb studs and axis lock. That kinda sucks cause it's a Christmas present for Gramps. I know I would be mad if it was mine and I never used it and it looked dirty and I couldn't really clean it off.\n\nThe Hook had exactly the same problem with looking dirty after breaking it in. The problem I have with the hook is that there isn't much room for your thumb to get the thumb stud. Once the Hook is out, it has quite a bit of wiggle side to side. It's not really a problem, but I'm just letting you people know. It doesn't have a lock bar so it just pushes back into it's home, that might be the cause of the blade play (I'm pretty sure it is). The detent is perfect though if you can get a hold of the thumb stud.\n\nThe G10 is kinda ruff so you can have a very sure grip on it, but it's a freaking rescue knife, a good grip should be expected. Though, it may not be the best EDC for a regular person because it is so rough on the pocket. The size is fine, but it does make it a little hard to deploy the blade.", "summary": "You Should Probably Get The Black Model", "unixReviewTime": 1419724800}

I work outdoors, and frequently wear cargo shorts or jeans, and I have had no negative issues with this holster.  The only downside, which isn't a big enough deal to knock a star IMO, is that with the open top, and open bottom, if you carry it frequenly in your pocket, you will get some pocket lint build-up on/in your gun.  If you clean your gun like you should, this isn't really an issue.\n\nThe outside of the holster has rubber, grippy material to it.  It isn't overly abrasive, and it does soften up some with use, but not enough to where the holster doesn't stay in your pocket when you draw.  The interior material of the holster is soft and protects your firearm well.  So far I have used this in cold temperatures when it was snowing, and 90 degree humid temperatures now where I'm covered in sweat, and I have had no rust problems on my gun from moisture issues with the holster.\n\nI have used Uncle Mikes, Blackhawk, and Maxpedition holsters in the past, and The Nemesis is hands down the best one I've ever owned for daily pocket carry.  I have had no issues with printing that I'm aware of, at least I've never had anybody mention my gun or ask if I was carrying a gun.

It is big enough to stand in if you are average height(i'm 5'10).\n\nThe only downside I've seen to it is that without the rain cover (gray top in the picture) you have no privacy,you won't be able to change clothes without the gray canvas over top. Other than that its a pretty nice tent. Spacious inside,enough height for an average sized person to stand up in and easy setup.\n\nThis is a great deal for an 8 person tent, Wal-Mart was wanting $120 for a 6 person tent so this is definitely a better deal.\n\nWould I recommend this?

I just use a black rubber band as a replacement.\n\nThe backlighting is not that great but I rarely use it anyway.\n\nAside from that, I had replaced the battery (CR1632) of the watch unit just once and had yet to replace the battery of the HR sensor unit.\n\nI use the HR sensor unit about 2-3 times a week when I ride my bike and each time, before use, I clean it - the rubberized area under the sensor- with 91% isopropyl alcohol (but any grade would be probably OK) before applying a small dab of Spectra electrode gel.\n\nI rarely get an error message ('transmitter error') on the unit since I used the electrode gel.\n\nThe band on the HR sensor unit is very much in good shape - no noticeable sag nor wrinkling on the edges - even after those months, perspiration and all.  Most elasticized bands sag just after several uses but this one is really durable and good quality.\n\nI also clean the watch unit - specially the underside - and well as the straps with a piece of tissue paper dabbed with isopropyl alcohol when my wrist start to itch to remove the buildup of grime.  However, I didn't suffer any allergic reactions to the strap --- just the usual skins marks since I rarely take off the unit off my wrist.\n\nIt's truly waterproof (the watch unit) and I had used it in both salt and fresh water environments although the most I have been under water was probably 15 feet.  I had never tried using the HR sensor unit under water if it's also waterproof, though.\n\nFor the price I paid - about $74 (tax inclusive), I believe I had gotten my money's worth and that's the bottom line.\n\nIt's not fancy and have no snob-appeal,  but it just works.\n\nmid-Aug. 2017 update:\n\nI am really impressed with the quality of the HR monitor band. It had been almost 2 1/2 years of constant use (primarily while riding my bike, 2-3 times a week) and looks like it just had very minimal wear.  No visible sagging nor discoloration in spite of body salt, grime, etc..  I have yet to replace the battery of the HR monitor.\n\nI had replaced the watch strap - also bought off Amazon - with a $8 replacement (although it was narrower -woman's/ladies-version) sometime Nov 2016 and had just replaced the watch battery (CR 1632) this month --just the 2nd time since I purchased the unit in April 2015.\n\nI am really impressed with this Polar FT7 watch which I decided over the first version of the Apple Watch.  Eventually, my decision to go with this Polar was not to have a fitness watch that I will need to charge , at least,  every other day.  The FT7's battery is so easy to replace.\n\nNot only the decision saved me a lot of money, the product is still very, very useful as of this review update!", "summary": "Simple and functional - Truly got my money's worth since the time I bought it", "unixReviewTime": 1477612800}

You aren't holding some skinny little bottle, and you aren't gripping some huge can that has a handle or something.  This makes it convenient in the moment, that you grip it, point it, and shoot it.\n2) \"Trigger\" both keeps it safe from going off when you don't want to because there is a spring loaded flap that covers the trigger, but easily sliding your thumb underneath it gives you access to a nice fat pad to push down on, and you are guaranteed to be pointing it in the right direction.  Point your thumb where you want to shoot!\nOther than that, I can't offer.  If it can drop a guy, dog, bear, or whether it will just really piss him off, I don't know.

It's very large especially when fully filled out. This pouch would be at home on a backpack, thigh rig, EMT bag, or riding in the back of a vehicle. This is not the pouch to buy if you want to carry a FAK on a belt, plate carrier or chest rig: it's just too large and gets in the way.\n\nThat said, it's a great pouch. Very roomy inside with plenty of strapping and loops to hold everything down. There's a fold-out mesh pocket for small things like band-aids, alcohol wipes, and tubes of antibiotic cream. It's compartmentalized quite well allowing for excellent organization, which is critical for a FAK. The outside front of the pouch has a large loop field for various patches (morale, name tape, blood type, drug allergy, etc.) and 3 rows of MOLLE webbing for attaching additional pouches. I don't think i'd suggest it though: the pouch is retained to the rip-away panel by the large velcro field on the back, as well as a nylon strap with a fastex buckle out front. If you put additional pouches on the front, the strap may not be long enough to be used. Not good if the pouch gets snagged and ripped off the velcro field. At most, I'd use the front MOLLE webbing to hold  things like pens, chem-lights and similar small things.\n\nNow a negative. The back of the rip-away panel has MOLLE webbing every other row, rather than every row. I'm a bit disappointed by this because right now I'm hanging this off a belt and it moves around way too much. If it had MOLLE every row I could get it down tight like the Pistol Mag pouch. But, as I said, it's not meant for belt use. On a pack or bag with a large MOLLE field, this pouch can be anchored down solidly, which is important because the velcro holds the pouch to the panel tightly, requiring a good bit of force to pull off.\n\nOverall it's a good pouch, but think about what you need before you buy.\n\nThe one I received is their newer version. On this one, the back of the rip-away panel has the threading strips stitched to the panel: the old version has fully removable straps. If one or the other is important to you, consider buying somewhere when you can see the product beforehand. Otherwise, it doesn't really matter.\n\nIt's typical Condor quality. The stitching is solid, the nylon is fairly heavy and stiff, and velcro good and grippy. I expect it to last a good long time with moderate use.

It wasn't too tight and wasn't too loose, it just fit. Since I bought my first one in graphite, I decided I needed a black one as well. I ordered the same MD/LG size about a year ago and it came fitting extremely small. So small that it would leave a ring around my forehead and cause me to get a headache after an hour or so of wearing it. So I decided to retire my graphite hat and buy a new one. Since the MD/LG in the black was so tight I could only conclude that the sizing has went smaller than what it had been before, so I ordered a LG/XL this time. Now it is too big, however for anyone who wears hats you know that having it slightly too big is much better than having it too tight.\n\nI've noticed sizing differences in all of their products, I don't know what they are doing differently, but a little consistency would keep me as a loyal customer.", "summary": "Sizes lack consistency", "unixReviewTime": 1454544000}

It is good looking, well-made (for the price) and durable thus far. Only con is that it seems to gain couple seconds a day, therefore, at the end of the month, it is about minute or two fast -  I suppose it's better than  being slow but this is expected from a non-quartz movement type of watches that use unadjusted automatic movement.  It's a trade-off for not having the need to replace the battery every few years.  If you are like me and like to wear different watches for different occasions, auto-movement watches can be a pain unless you invest in auto-winder or two.\n\nI disagree with some people; I think Invicta watches in general (I have several Invictas) have decent bands that are nicely finished and have sufficient heft to them. Compared to comparable Seiko 5 automatic watches, Seikos have cheap, light weight, rough feel to them, although the Seiko 5 are also a good choice for a daily beater - their bands tend to give out long before their auto-movements do. These Pro Diver series that ape Rolex/Omega design are the ones that put Invicta on the map in the watch world.\n\nAlthough the style is easy to copy, customer service apparently is not as noted by many user here and other watch forums.

She's the best!\n\nI got the 4 inch version as the 6 incher would run afoul of my state's max blade length. As always make sure you are familiar with your local laws.\n\nThe knife arrived sharp enough to shave the hair off the back of my hand. Construction appears to be first rate. I'm not a huge fan of liner locks but that is just a personal preference. This knife locks up nice and tight and there are no worries about it collapsing on your fingers. I do not find it hard to disengage the lock to fold it, nor is it too easy where one would fear an unintentional disengagement.\n\nUsing the thumb stud the blade swings out fairly smoothly, though it is initially a bit stiff. Perhaps this will ease up over time but in any case it isn't oppressive. On the top and bottom of the base of the blade are two small serrated finger guards. The top one remains fully exposed when the knife is closed, the purpose of which is to catch on your pants as you draw the knife from your pocket to open the knife for you. I've found that unless I consciously try to do this it doesn't work, and even why I try to it is hit or miss. There is nothing wrong with this feature per se, but do not buy this knife specifically for this. Also, don't rely on it to speed up the time it takes to get your knife into action in an emergency. You are much better off practicing opening the knife manually...and won't wear holes in your jeans from the constant friction.\n\nIn all this is a very nice defensive knife. It isn't a jack of all trades like many pocketknives tend to be...it was deigned purely as a defensive weapon. If this is what you need and enjoy the elegant lines and feel of a butterfly style knife but can't have/don't want one of those than this Cold Steel should be on your short list.", "summary": "Nice Knife", "unixReviewTime": 1309651200}

This didn't stop me, I just taped the knife up with first aid tape and when back home I replaced the pins with 5/16x3/4\" tension pins, epoxyed the thing together, and then wrapped electrical tape on the handle. She's pretty bomb proof now and if you are going to throw this knife you should just start by disassemblying the handle and epoxy gluing the entire thing.

I've made them myself, and use both the original Solo and Solo Titan.  I love this method of camp cooking for a few reasons, but I'll get into that in a moment.  First, to concentrate on the product at hand.\n\nThe stove comes in a nylon bag, nested in the pot, which also has a nylon bag.  Good packaging, as this keeps debris out of your pot.  For a size reference, a quart paint can is the same diameter as the stove and roughly the same height with the pot stand in its packed state.\n\nThe pot is a stainless steel pitcher with folding wire handles and graduated volume markings.  It works well on the Solo or any other small stove, like a Svea123.  The pot won't quite nest the Svea, to my disappointment, but it wasn't made to, so that isn't Solo's fault.\n\nUsing a wood gas stove has a bit of a learning curve.  You are making a tiny campfire in there and some care has to be taken to do it properly, so you can have enough fire to cook on.  Wax/Vaseline soaked cotton balls or those generic fire sticks you can get at walmart are the firestarters I use most often, and once burning its an easy thing to maintain a little fire in a small space, as long as you choose the proper fuel.  I'd suggest doing a couple of practice burns in the back yard before the first time out in the field, so you can learn the ins and outs of the stove.\n\nWhy a natural fuel stove in the first place though, isn't it easier to just screw on a gas bottle and boil away?  Well, yes and no.\n\nLiquid or gas fueled stoves need...fuel.  Which is stored in heavy containers, and will eventually run out.  For a survival tool, this is a huge problem.  Even stoves like my MSR Dragonfly, which will burn pretty much anything petrol based, will eventually fail because a small part will wear out, the pump on the fuel bottle will snap, an O-ring will go bad, etc.  Spares take up more space and weight in your pack.  If you are bugging out, you want a stove that weighs very little and doesn't need you to carry its fuel.\n\nThe beauty of the Solo amongst natural fuel stoves is its efficient burn, due to its secondary combustion.  You can find enough fallen twigs to boil water in mere moments.  The stove and pot together weigh less than my Svea123 considerably.  It is an excellent solution for lightweight backpackers and survivalists both.\n\nFor car camping I would suggest the Solo Titan.  It burns longer and can support cookwear for several.  The original Solo is a single person tool.\n\nThere are many reviews of this stove and other natural fuel and wood gas stoves out there, so new ground isn't being broken by mine.  The issue to consider is not \"should I get a Solo Stove, is it any good?\"  Yes, it is excellent at what it does.  The issue is \"Do I want a natural fuel stove?\" I find the advantages of natural fuel to outweigh the fact that they take a bit more tending during a boil, and are a bit messier than a gas stove.

If that doesn't work, you should have some sort of face cover on anyway.\nCorrect method for camo pattern: light colors on the nose, forehead, cheekbones, chin; darker colors elsewhere.

This trailer is an almost-perfect solution! The construction is VERY sturdy, it has massive carrying capacity (6 full grocery bags and handles the weight easily), aluminum frame makes it lightweight, AND best of all the 16\" front wheel which makes rolling it for distance a breeze - that wheel is definitely this unit's selling point as opposed to the 'shopping cart' front wheels you see on others. The only slight drawbacks are the somewhat difficult setup to hook it up to a bike, and I'd like it to have a solid bottom instead of nylon to make it sturdier for cargo. But it WAS designed to haul kids, and putting a bottom on was a pretty easy thing for me to do, so no big deal. All in all, the price for a unit like this makes it a great deal (I do have to mention I bought it a couple of weeks ago when the price was $45 cheaper!

Perhaps one should also wear a glove and hold the riser a bit low. There are little bumps on the riser for a better grip; when I cut my hand I had my index finger above the first bump, which put the arrow rest pretty much flush with the top of my hand. Putting your index finger between the two bumps will get the top of your hand out of the way, though with my adult male hands being on the bigger side of average my pinky slips a little off the bottom because this bow is designed for young beginners. I would also suggest replacing the string; the one it comes with seems to be a type of paracord and a bit too thin for my arrows nocks to grip.

The first thing that I noticed was the beautiful steel body of the shaker.  This aspect ensures that this is a product that can be used over a lifetime.  It is durable and prohibits absorption so you won't have to worry about how you will get that funky smell out!  The lid snaps closed very securely so there is no worry about your shakes or other liquids leaking or spilling from a lid that isn't secure.  The entire lid itself screws on and off easily.  There are convenient measurements on the side of the shaker and a beautiful etched logo on the front.  The bottom portion screws off to reveal a multipurpose storage compartment!  Good for protein powders, snacks or to use as a mini serving cup/bowl for the liquid content.  I was surprised to find a wire ball inside of the shaker that is to be used when shaking your drink to ensure the powder breaks up well and is dispersed throughout the drink, making sure to make a perfect shake every time!  This is a high quality product and I would recommend it!  I must disclose that I received this product free of charge to review and share my honest and unbiased opinion.

But, as I previously stated, I have not broken it in yet as they recommend, so maybe that would have helped with the smell. Once I used it for a bit and washed it a few times, the smell is gone and I am happy with the stickiness of the mat. At first it was a bit slippery, but that had subsided.

The worst abuse it has seen is going off a curb at low speed every once in a while. I mention the details of my commute because I think it may give some perspective when considering con #2 below.\n\nPros:\n-It is neat that the basket is removable. I never use it, but it's good to have the option. This is really what sold me on the basket in the first place.\n-The basket stays firmly attached to the basket hardware when on the bike. No troubles there.\n\nCons:\n-The bottom of the hardware rests on the front of handlebar post where it exits the frame. This has a tendency to sway away from the bike at times. I'm not sure if it is just my bike, but I solved the problem with a zip tie and a smile.\n-One of the two bottom hooks on the hardware holding the basket broke off about a month ago. The good news here is that it is still held firmly enough for my comfort by the remaining three attachment points (two top and now one bottom hook). It has a little more play in it, but nothing that would cause the contents to go tumbling out.\n\nI give it three stars for mediocre design and modest durability.", "summary": "but not great.

Pattern on back is especially excellent and uniform.\n* Very durable!!  I subjected the enclosed KEM card which is of equivalent thickness and construction to test abuse.

It is so annoying in appearance that I down rated to 4 Stars just because of it!

My initial impressions of this one are that it is a very good idea and a remarkable bargain for such quality at under $70.  Upon receiving it, I expended an entire aerosol can of waterproofing on its inside and outside.  It is tightly and strongly made, and there are many nooks and crannies.  The product video will help some purchasers assemble it.  True, it is not an ideal backpack, but it can certainly be carried short distances.  More importantly, it is a great disguise.  I live in a high rise situated in a university town where backpacks are ubiquitous and firearms are not universally loved. I wish I had ordered the green one. Even in brown, it attracts no attention in elevators, hallways, parking lots, etc.  It needs, as other reviewers mention, external Molle attachment strips, and all of the velcro should to be about twice as wide.  The initial design appears to originate with competitive shooters - thus the many magazine loops, stapler pouch, etc., that are useful for those who want to score points in shooting games.  Of the five external pockets, three are the same small size, just right for competitors' magazines, but impractical for much else. Two of these could usefully  be replaced with a single, general-purpose pocket.  Happily, more serious shooters with practical goals will find that the pack's fundamental design allows much customization.  To accommodate the procedures of an indoor range where I often teach, I have added an external earmuff container and a tube to contain rolled targets of the appropriate size.  If the pack holds up under hard use, I'll probably buy another in green and set it up for outdoor ranges.  By then, this company or a competitor may offer a similar pack with more adaptable features..  As it is, even with a few shortcomings, this is a solid piece of gear at a very favorable price.", "summary": "Solid effort.  Needs refinement.", "unixReviewTime": 1521849600}

The zippers which hold the removable side bags seal upward instead of downward.

Hammer", "reviewText": "Let's get the big controversy out of the way first: The trailer as a whole is great but as others have reported the tires that come with it are junk. But it's so inexpensive - I paid a few pennies more than eighty-four dollars here on Amazon - I didn't hold the tires against it. Since I read the reviews before making my purchase, I expected the tires to be low quality Chinese junk. I don't know if the tubes are equally crappy because I haven't yet needed to remove the tires to look at the tubes. I haven't had any trouble with them yet but if I have flats or blowouts I've got the right size tubes in my spare parts box already since the front wheel of my recumbent uses the same size tubes (16\"/305 x 1.75\"). If I ever take the trailer any real distance I'll bring spare tubes for it just as I bring spare tubes for my bike on such a trip. And while the tires are junk they aren't going to be holding the weight of an adult, only a max of 70lbs and usually a lot less, so I don't think they'll be a problem. If the tires do prove to be a problem there are a bunch of 16\"/305 tires in my local bike shop and here on Amazon, some relatively inexpensive but plenty good enough (such as Kenda Kwests) and others a bit more expensive but really, really good (such as Schwalbe Big Apples or Marathon GGs). For now I'll use the included tires and tubes until they wear out or cause a problem; I am prepared for but don't expect a problem and they should last a year or more before needing replacement.\n\nI am moving along an asymptote toward a nearly car-free lifestyle. I do most of my local travel, errands, and visiting using a bike; mostly my Sun EZ-1 Lite recumbent although I also have an early-90s Schwinn hybrid and a little Dahon folder. The one thing I found myself still wanting a car for is to do shopping trips that involve bulk items such as paper towels, larger potted plants, etc. The solution to this is a cargo trailer. There are lots available and I did my research, eventually settling on the Burley Travoy. Unfortunately, there is no good way to get the Travoy's hitch to work with my EZ-1 because it has no seat tube and the rack is too low to the ground; too bad because I really liked the ability to use the Travoy cargo trailer as a handcart. After spending over a month trying to come up with inventive ways to get the Travoy hitched to my EZ-1, I went back to research mode and narrowed my choices down to the Burley Nomad and the Allen Sports ACT200 Explorer. The Nomad is a very high-quality trailer from a company well-known for its high-quality products, with more interior cargo space and a higher weight capacity than the Explorer. The Nomad is also lighter because it has an aluminum frame vs the Explorer's steel frame and a much better-designed hitch using an elastomer vs the Explorer's universal joint. But the Explorer had two things going for it that I liked a lot: It could be quickly converted to a convenient handcart mode and it was way, way, WAY less expensive than the Nomad. Even at the highest prices I saw for the Explorer (around one-hundred twenty five) and the lowest I saw for the Nomad (around two-hundred thirty) there was a one-hundred dollar difference - you can pretty much buy two or three Explorers for the price of one Nomad. Even if the reviews claiming that the Explorer's included tires and tubes were so bad they would need to be immediately replaced were true, the Explorer remained a bargain. So I decided to at least give the Explorer a try since the price was so appealing and it had that handcart mode.\n\nThe Explorer cargo trailer comes almost fully assembled in its box. Just lift it out of the box, unzip the zipper, pull the wheels out of the cargo compartment, pop the wheels on, then attach the hitch arm to the trailer. This takes barely longer to do than it does to read about. After that, attach the hitch plate to your bike's rear axle. I purchased two extra hitch plates directly from Allen Sports (they're not available here on Amazon) in order to have a hitch plate on all three of my bikes. This is also trivially easy to do, although it's possible with a quick-release rear hub that you'll find that the hitch plate is thick enough so that the skewer won't be long enough with the hitch plate attached. If that's the case, go to your local bike shop or look around here on Amazon or another online store for a longer skewer; they're not expensive and they're easy to find. The hitch plate fit fine on my Schwinn (quick-release skewer) and Dahon (nutted axle) but not on my EZ-1 (quick-release skewer) but I had a longer skewer for the EZ-1 sitting in my spare parts box so that didn't slow me down.\n\nI did experience a moment of confusion when attaching the wheels. At first, I thought that the wheel axles were supposed to go under the trailer bed, partially supporting the trailer bed. But the first time I put a load into the trailer bed, the trailer bed sagged down and the axles poked into the sides of the trailer. I communicated via email with Allen Sports and they told me that the axles are SUPPOSED to poke into the sides of the trailer and in fact the cargo compartment is reinforced in that area to prevent damage. This is not apparent in any of the pictures or videos I saw before my purchase but you'll see the reinforced patches right away as you pull the trailer out of its box; I thought they were just decorative at first.\n\nBefore putting the wheels on, pressurize them. The tires on the wheels are rated for 30-60PSI but there is a stick-on label on the wheels that says \"30 PSI MAX\" so pump them to 30PSI, no higher. If you don't have a pump with a pressure gauge, get one. If you over pressurize and the crappy tubes pop the crappy tires off the rims or the crappy tubes =POP= that's probably your fault, not the fault of Allen Sports or Amazon. By the way, the wheels are mostly plastic but they seem to be perfectly round and straight; weird if you're used to \"normal\" bike wheels with separate hub, spokes, and rim but they seem to work fine and certainly there should be no need for truing these wheels or using rim tape to protect the inner tube from the nonexistent spokes.\n\nThe universal joint at the end of the hitch arm which attaches to the hitch plate on the bike works fine. It's a good inexpensive way to allow the bike to move in relation to the trailer without damaging the hitch arm, trailer, or bike. The trailer can flip over without affecting your bike (other than the drag if you keep riding, of course), or you can lay your bike down on the ground without affecting the trailer. An elastomer would be better as a universal joint can get stiff or even experience damage if movement occurs around more than one axis simultaneously; but of course the universal joint is much less expensive and that's what you get with the Explorer: An inexpensive solution that works.\n\nI don't notice the empty trailer behind my bike at all, except for the noise of it bouncing around on the potholes. The first couple of times I used it on smooth roads I had to keep looking back to be sure it was still there; when empty, it doesn't affect the handling of the bike at all and even though it's 20lbs empty I didn't notice it even on uphills. Loaded with 60lbs of soil from the garden store, sure, I noticed it going uphill but on the flats or downhills it was like it wasn't there except when starting or stopping. Of course it's harder to ride uphill pulling more weight and it takes a little more effort to accelerate and you have to give yourself more room to brake to a stop from a high speed. Physics, DUH! The trailer itself, however, rides better with a load than without because at 20lbs empty it bounces around on rough road quite a bit but even a modest load, another 20lbs or so, helps to keep it from bouncing around. Low-pressure tires designed for shock absorption, such as the Schwalbe Big Apple, would probably reduce the bouncing while unloaded.\n\nThe zippered compartment, when zipped closed, is 26\" long/19\" wide/7\" high which looks and functions larger than it sounds. It's good for small items and pizzas. For most shopping, the zippered compartment works nicely and holds quite a bit of stuff, more than the two baskets on my Schwinn combined. It's also good for keeping things inside clean (freshly washed laundry, for example) and dry (the cargo compartment isn't waterproof but if you get caught in a sprinkle for a short time it's better than nothing). The cargo compartment also has an interior divider that can be zipped up or folded flat, leaving a slightly larger space in the rear and a slightly smaller space in the front. It's hard to get stuff into or out of the rear space when the divider is zipped up because the top cover gets in the way. It might be useful for people carrying only a few items, or if you want to be able to reach some items easily while keeping other stuff covered. But I haven't used the divider yet, I just keep it unzipped and folded flat, leaving one large space in the cargo compartment. I often find myself unzipping the top, laying it mostly flat on the trailer bed, and then putting bulky items on top of that. The interior side panels have three tie-down ring anchors each and I keep three long bungies and a cargo net to use with them; the cargo net for multiple smaller items and the bungies for big items like a box I have to bring to the post office.\n\nOne of the things I like most about the Explorer is handcart mode. To go from trailer mode to handcart mode, just detach the hitch arm from your bike, unscrew a big black knob on the trailer, swivel the hitch arm from horizontal to vertical, then screw down that big black knob to tighten the hitch arm in that position. It's great for shopping because you  fill it up as you walk around the store, unload it at checkout, then load it back up again after paying with no need to waste plastic or paper bags. No need to compete with other shoppers for a cart because you have your own and no worries that you're buying too much stuff to bring home in a single trip. It's not quite as useful or convenient to use this way as a Travoy, but at 1/2-1/3 the price of a Travoy the Explorer is plenty good enough.\n\nTo repeat the point of the first paragraph of this review: Please note that my 5-star rating is not a comment on the quality of the tires and tubes. I've seen the tires, I agree with other reviews that they are crap. I haven't seen the tubes (because they're inside the tires and I haven't yet needed to remove the tires) yet I have no doubt that they're crap, too. But I haven't had issues with them and I have spare tubes on hand if needed, and replacement tires are easy to get if and when needed. The welds on the steel parts as well as all the other bits of the trailer don't have the quality one would get from Burley but everything is functional and strong. Given the price, this trailer is an excellent value. You can pay more (a LOT more) and get better quality. You can't pay less; I don't think there is even a half-decent cargo trailer made by anyone available for a lower price. The handcart mode is invaluable for me and the standard axle hitch attachment makes it usable with any bike, including my EZ-1. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a bargain cargo trailer and for whom the 70lb weight capacity is sufficient.\n\nedit 2015-01-17: I've been using the trailer frequently for a couple of months now and I remain very pleased with it. However, note my comment above about the universal joint. Last night while bringing home pizza for the family, the joint locked up and the trailer flipped onto its side while I was making a turn. I had to disconnect the hitch and \"work it\" with my hands to loosen it up, after which I reattached it and completed the ride home without incident. I have a feeling this will happen every now and then. Infrequently, but it will happen. Universal joints usually work fine, but they can lock up as mine did last night. While I'm not deducting a star, it would be better if Allen Sports replaced the universal joint with an elastomer or even a metal spring.", "summary": "Quality of some parts fairly low but this is a great value for a new cargo trailer.", "unixReviewTime": 1413158400}

Like ALL molle backed gear, the attached straps on the back arrive underneath the horizontal straps. If u unsnap the straps and pull them out, then resnap them OVER TOP of the small horizontal straps, it will accomodate ANY belt, as long as its about 3.5 in wide or less. Thickness is not an issue.\n  Which brings me to the next point......the pull the dot snaps, litterally are just that. They are designed so as to never accidentally open, and if u pull the strap at the TOP where the dot is, they unbutton. Then do the opposite when snapping back together, push them on from the bottom side. I found it a little confusing at first, but after getting the hang of it its no prob....\n  I own this model and the other original model by rowan (the same co. That makes esee knives), and tho i am typically a fan of rowan stuff over ontario, i do like the ontario model a little bit more....im not going to be some fanboy blabbering about magical heat treats and what not (i love esee knives but some people take it WAY too far).....this ontario model has thicker handle scales. It feels better in the hand.\n  For the guy complaining about fading skulls, that will happen naturally with use regardless, there is nothing that you can do. Laser engraving will wear away on micarta, its the nature of the beast. As a side note, you can soak micarta scales in clothing die and they will take the color. Of course u have to go darker and will lose the skulls that would get lost anyways with actual use....\n  This may sound bad but i believe it to be true......if u don't know how to sharpen a knife, you have no place spending good money on it. There are a multitude of sharpening systems out there for relatively cheap, get one that works for u before buying knives. I prefer good old fashioned stones (freehand), and finish with a diamond coated rod, and strop....thats just me. I end up sharpening almost ALL my new knives, no matter how sharp.....its rarely sharp enough for my liking straight out of box.....\n  I just love the design of this knife. It just plain feels right in my hand. The thumb jimping gives you hell of a lot of leverage, and this knife is a little beast. The only one area that it won't cover is chopping, which is fine with me, tools for the job. I carry hatchets or machetes for that stuff.\n  So there you have it....this knife kicks ass!

I was quite happy with my first watch, but less so with this one - kinda. I'll explain in a moment.\n\nLooks-wise it's great. Beautiful orange face, nice hands, nice bracelet (no, the rubber one is NOT included, as others have said). The bracelet does come HUGE, but despite what I've read in another review, you don't need a dedicated sizing kit to resolve that  - you need a thing metal pin to push the pin out though. It's not particularly easy, but not hard - I can't remember what I used, but it wasn't a big issues. However, how to size it isn't explained anywhere in the manual, which is a generic book covering many of their watches. Kind of bogus, frankly.\n\nOnce sized properly, the bracelet fits and feels fine. No hairs are getting pulled on my wrist, which is nice - that happens sometimes with metal bracelets. It thus far has been fairly accurate as well, so that's a plus. I also like the little magnifying section over the date area. The face is smaller than I thought it would be though; closer to a woman's diving watch size then a man's. Had I seen it and tried it on in person, I think I would have passed, and looked for a slightly larger one - that's personal taste though, and I can see some people perfectly happy with it (I still do wear it - it's not THAT small).\n\nHowever, as with my other Invicta watch, there is a bit of play in the movement. The second hand doesn't come close to hitting the hash marks on the face, and when you set the time (while I'm on setting, it's one click for date, two for time, and no screw-down crown as you might expect in a diving watch, thogh perhaps not one this cheap), you can turn the crown a bit in each direction without moving the minute hand, making it tough to set it perfectly and make sure it will hit the hash marks after a full minute.\n\nThe big negative for me isn't functional, but may point to a lack of care in construction. The bezel (which is actually pretty tough to turn, which is a good thing) doesn't lie consistently around the edge of the crystal. If I run my finger across the face, it's flush on one side, and actually raised up above the crystal on the other. I believe this is just the thin metal ring with the numbers on it (I don't believe there's a leak or anything - been swimming and showering without issue), but I still feel like it shouldn't catch my finger with a sharp metal edge when I touch it.  It wouldn't cut me, but it is, to me, a sign of slightly low quality control and I wonder if that will carry through the rest of the watch.\n\nThus far though, it hasn't. The crystal seems tough (I've banged it into a few things with no scratches) the time is accurate enough, and it's very comfortable. If you like the looks and don't care about things like a screw-in crown or the absolute highest level of fit and finish, it's an ok value for under a c-note (let's say more than a buck under, though). If, like me, you get obsessive over things like the bezel issue I mentioned, you might want to look elsewhere.", "summary": "Nice Looking - Inconsistent Build", "unixReviewTime": 1326844800}

Upon inspection, it seems to be a fairly well build paddle considering the price. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the connection point in the center (this is a two piece paddle by the way) seems to be just a little bit loose. I put a little bit of teflon tape on it, and it is snug now, so no problem. I have not taken it out into the waves yet, but I expect it will last. I'll update this after I take it out a few times.\n\nProduct Update: So, I've taken it out in green flag and yellow flag (which I probably shouldn't have) surf conditions. Keep in mind, this thing is long, so it gets tiring to use it for long periods of time. HOWEVER, I am growing to like the length, especially in rough surf. The length allows me to get that blade down into the surf to make last second course corrections to avoid flipping. I'm glad I got the long one. If you are going to paddle in light surf or bay/lake conditions, get a shorter paddle. You will kill yourself with this thing.\n\nProduct Update #2: It's been quite a while now since I bought the first one. It got older after a LOT of use and I can't get the joint apart anymore. However, I just bought another one. You simply can't beat the price. It is light enough to use for a while without getting tired (I repeat though, if you are going in very calm conditions frequently get a shorter paddle). Joint on the new one is a little loose just like the first, but the first one never gave me any problems, and I used it to get out in 5-6 foot swells (not my wisest idea)...", "summary": "Great paddle for the price!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1452470400}

I was about a 30 yard shot, went through both sides of the deer.  I found her about 40 yards from where I shot her.\n\nSmall drawbacks:  the scope is not the best quality.  It does work OK, but there is some distortion at the edge of the field.  My first string frayed and began to unwind after only a few shots.  I emailed the manufacturer and they sent me 2 free replacement strings in the mail.  The bolts are crap, throw them away and use better ones.  Even with there cons, I think its a great deal.  I thought about buying a more expensive one, but this one works fine, I might just use it indefinitely.", "summary": "Gets the job done!", "unixReviewTime": 1412380800}

When I received this knife in very short order, I thought this might have been a mistake. I mean really, how can one take a knife with bright orange markings seriously, right? Other than being the trade mark of this Gerber brand that turns out to be no challenge at all. This fixed blade knife is about 7 3/4 inches overall length, with a 3 1/2 inch blade. In my state, nice and legal as an EDC, even if concealed I would not expect any hassle due to its size. It arrived very quickly, in excellent condition, well packaged and the knife is sheathed in a molded, heavy-duty, formed  plastic with the Gerber logo. The knife easily slides and clicks into a secure, yet easily removable position in the sheath. No special tricks are needed to remove the knife, but it remains securely in place and may be worn in or outside the waistband or boot. I was surprised at how sharp the blade was upon receipt, but still added a surgical edge myself. I like the drop point blades versus the tanto tip as a personal preference. The blade edge is a functional combination of straight edge and serrated for multiple uses. The first time I wore the knife on my waistband I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortably it 'snuggled' into my side and just a little higher than my other EDC knives.\n\nThis is a great little fixed blade knife for a multiple use tool or convenient EDC. I don't think I would be whacking on tree limbs and things with it, but then again, that is not the purpose or reason I purchased it.

I tried it out and it works.\n\nI noted that one person said the brush broke off inside their tubing.

Thankfully, all three of the brushes sent to me remain firmly attached to their handles as did the bristles. I also noted the strength of the long cable attached to the tubing brush, again, I did not want to destroy my tubing due to a faulty brush.\n\nThis set is a universal set but it won't clean all packs equally well. I found this to be around 3 inches too short to fully clean my tubing. When I clean tubing, I want the bristles to exit the other side, not be a few inches from the end. This is my fault, I should have measured before accepting the review request. I did not feel as if the brushes ends were going to break off, but I tested before use. I found no problems with damage to the brush, the cables, handles or most importantly, to my tubing!\n\nThe other two brushes work very well. I was able to clean out my bite tube, and the hanger is the greatest for helping my pack dry.

Manner", "reviewText": "I just installed this bracket on my concrete garage wall. This unit is quite heavy, and provides for infinite adjustment which was my major reason for purchase versus the alternatives. As noted in prior reviews, the installation instruction are sparse regarding wall mounting, and the correct height to mount on a wall. Here are some of my installation suggestions and hints. First, I suggest that you test assemble it loosely with all of the components that you will be using for your installation on a workbench, so that you can see everything working together before you mount it (there will be parts left over). From that test assembly, I determined the amount of travel (elevation adjustment) available in the screw jack. If you mount the the bottom of the base plate on the wall at 8' above the driveway the rim height can be adjusted from about 7' to just over 10' at the top of the screw's travel. (The instructions give a minimum elevation reference from a hole in the middle of the mount to the ground, which is an odd way to provide this measurement.) I mounted the base plate into the solid concrete beam over the garage door, with 4\" lag screws into long lag screw expanding sheilds. My only complaint about the screw jack mechanism is that is seemed to be inadequately lubricated from the factory. I took mine apart (remove the hook from the bottom) and discovered that it had only a small smear of grease on the middle of the screw. I completely greased the screw, the bearing washers and the sliding surfaces of the tubes with white lithium grease. This makes the action smoother, and will hopefully prevent corrosion. Lastly, when doing the final mounting, do not tighten all of the fasteners completely in each step of assembly. Having some \"play\" in the joints makes getting all of the bolt holes to line up easier. I did this entire installation alone (not recommended) and offer this last tip for the most awkward part of the assembly, mounting the backboard to the elevator arms. I held the backboard upside-down and backwards to then insert the bottom bolt through the bottom elevator arms and through the bottom backboard mounting holes. The bottom arms are hanging low to the ground at this point, so you're lower on the ladder, and more stable in this position. Then using the bottom bolt as a pivot point, swing the backboard upward into its final position (with the upper arms cranked down to the lowest position to make it easier to reach) and insert the upper bolt through the upper arms and upper backboard mounting holes. I did mounted the backboard without the rim in place to make it less cumbersome and lighter. When the mount and the backboard are all loosely assembled, then go back and tighten all of the fasteners to their final tightness.", "summary": "Excellent adjustment features - Review with installation notes", "unixReviewTime": 1278201600}

You don't have to worry about it falling out or losing it. There is a lanyard hole at the end of the knife, as well as holes in the knife sheath if you want to lace in some paracord.\n\nKa-Bar made this knife like a tank.

At this length you will cut the rope with wire cutters and feed the wire rope through the handle ball then slide on the silver screw stop and place the black cap on the ends of the rope for protection from the wire, now tighten down the silver screw stop with a screw driver. You are ready to start jumping.\n\nThe swing of the rope is really smooth and I am currently working on getting double unders. This is a great speed rope for crossfit, boxing, MMA, and kind of cardio endurance workout. However I would not recommend using this on rough concrete or asphalt, the coating around the wire will easily wear through.

Heating water takes some time, but goes much faster if you put the bag on the roof or hood of your car. Going without showers during camping can be a little bit stinky, but now there is no excuse. Getting a shower is super refreshing...it is great to get the sweat and smoke smell off of your body. For this price you cant really go wrong. It packs up small and 5 gallons is plenty of water for two-three people if you know how to conserve water.\n\nWe fill it with water and lay it in the sun for 2-3 hours, hoist it up on a post in the shower, and the two of us can shower with more than enough hot water. To be sure, we both have very short hair; some with lots of hair may run short to get a complete rinse.\nI really recommend it to anyone who loves camping and cant go out too long without showering, it does get the job done.

And while I love it, I can not say that I'm IN love with it. The pros for this tool are the Allen assembly that allows you to swap out tools, and completely disassemble the tool for cleaning. The plier heads can be angled to get into tight spaces. The overall design is ultra sleek, and lightweight.\n\nThe cons I found with this multi tool were odd, didn't affect it's daily use, and with care (and in my case brains :P) could easily be overcome. The tools don't actually 'lock' into place, when they fold out they seem to be held just by compression. This is fine for most uses but just be careful not to go trying to break a stubborn bolt loose, or you will ruin your knuckles. When using the pliers, think carefully about where you want your hands to go when the head folds up or down unexpectedly. I have used the angle headed feature maybe a handful of times, always just to grab something that fell, never to try and loosen something with it. I was slightly disappointed with the number of tools available from SOG to swap out. Sure a seatbelt cutter is awesome, but I feel that they really could use this design as a skunk works to test new concepts in what a multi tool could be. swap out all 5 tools on one side for a spring loaded window punch? Why not? Instead of pliers, have a RG45 crimper? Crazier things have been tried, and who knows maybe it changes the world of multi tool forever.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend the Paratool for anyone who needs a smaller, lightweight tool for tightening the occasional screw. And cracking the occasional beer. For something that is a little easier to open one handed, check out a gerber. But for a utilitarian tough as nails multi tool that you can break down to your zany little fixer hearts content, look no further.", "summary": "It's not you baby, it's me!", "unixReviewTime": 1407369600}
